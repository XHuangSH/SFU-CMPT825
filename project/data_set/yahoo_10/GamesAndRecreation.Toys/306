question for toy collectors toy graders those who know their stuff i have an open shelf at home with the middle area like a sort of a rolltop desk in that it is covered by a wooden panel that is where i keep my figures in so that they are away from sunlight and most of the dust and stuff anyway i just found out that the shelf area near the middle has wood mold don't know how the moisture got in and stayed my question will the mold affect the figures inside the rolltop area supposing the spores somehow enter the slits the figures are in their mint condition btw unopened sealed carded and i know for a fact that moisture couldn't enter that easily in there so what damage could the mold do if ever there is a single silica gel packet keeping them company btw if you can't transfer your stuff at once then at least try to keep that area dry and free from moisture since you said it's enclosed i'm sure it won't be too much of a chore good luck Silica gel Wood Door Electrical wiring Plastic Explosive material Double-slit experiment Solar power Psoriasis Tofu Desiccation Rolltop desk Hamster Toxic mold Secretary desk Hard disk Tea Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve My Little Pony Straw-bale construction Plant Casting G.I.
