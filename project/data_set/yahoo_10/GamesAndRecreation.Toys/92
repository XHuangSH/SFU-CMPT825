transformers alternators where can i find transformers alternators at a cheap price my friend is a huge fan and i wanted to get him his three favorite ones for his birthday but on amazon they are so expensive like dollars on the hasbro website it says suggested retail is where can i find them at this price or near it please help at toywiz com you can find some and i emphasize some transformers alternators and binaltech figures near their suggested retail price it's not surprising that you've found them to be so expensive elsewhere as they're highly collectible toys because of their great detailing i have nine binaltech figures and two masterpiece figures you should consider pre ordering the figures in the future from an online retailer e g bigbadtoystore com toywiz com so that you get the best price usually these figures get marked up quickly after they are released due to high demand and limited production runs http www toywiz com trmaco html Alternators G.I.
