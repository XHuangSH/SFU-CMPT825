i ask again what is the point over a doll i hate people who think bratz is a bad influence and calling them ho's and stuff when they're the bad influence saying such things about a doll that is just for entertainment you people disgust me in everyway possible you make things that destory the planet and live not thinking when the planet could be destroyed the way were treating our planet is no better than a murderer becuase were killing animal's and plant's that could've cured a disease get over the doll it didnt do anything to you nor your children its how you raise them not what they play with know the old saying if you got nothing nice to say dont say anything exactly dont say anything at all so i ask again what is the point in saying bad stuff about a doll that has done nothing wrong to anyone its completely stupid and just plain wrong you people just make me want to cry because the way you act is absolutely horrible just think for once what you could be doing to make sure nothing happens to them instead of doing this i agree with sarah be polite and more people will listen to you me for instance i don't like bratz dolls their heads are too big but that doesn't mean i don't care about the earth i do care however if you don't want your daughter to dress like a bratz doll it's smart to not give her a bratz doll and it's hard to keep family and friends from giving her a bratz if she saw it on tv and is begging for it all over the place i agree with you that disliking bratz dolls is much less helpful to the earth than driving a hybrid car but it's quite possible to do both not that i drive a hybrid car i ride a bicycle Theory of conduct Kodocha Invader Zim Bratz Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Little Britain Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Doll Ranma __ characters Sin City Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Johnny the Homicidal Maniac The Inside The Fairly OddParents Taxi Driver Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion YuYu Hakusho Poker jargon Cliff Richard Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Toy Story 2 Philosophical skepticism Rei Ayanami Shit Futurama (TV series - season 5) Great Teacher Onizuka Married... with Children Final Fantasy: Unlimited Sarah Kerrigan EastEnders Ed, Edd n Eddy W.I.T.C.H.
