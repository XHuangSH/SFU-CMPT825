i have become so crazy about webkinz that i feel sick but i still love them and i still want to collect them i feel so sick from it but i still want to collect them so what should i do to not feel sick about it my mind is all thoughts about webkinz so ehat should i do i have and i don't feel sick once you start collecting them you start to feel better i felt the same way i totally disagree with the first person just because you feel sick doesn't mean you have to hate them if you really feel that bad just take a small break and see how you feel if you miss your webkinz on the break then you know you are feeling sick but are still happy with them around if you take a break and feel good about it its either webkinz isn't your thing or you just have been going on a lot and need a break hope this helps Kodocha Theory of conduct Nine Inch Nails Time Out of Mind Pitaten Social rule The Catcher in the Rye Vernon Schillinger Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Negima YuYu Hakusho Please Save My Earth Jon Secada Hall & Oates Charmed Samuel Goldwyn Saudade Wonderland (McFly album) Pok__mon Live!
