my nephew turns one next week any gift ideas i'm looking for something under something fun and educational would be ideal thanks i've got a great gift idea for you one that is certainly fun and educational buy your nephew books i give books for all occasions and i cannot emphasize enough how important i think it is that you consider giving books as gifts especially with so many negative influences impacting children nowadays please please please i beg you to buy this young boy something other than toys i firmly believe that if you buy him a toy you'll be wasting your money on something he'll outgrow in months if not years or tire of in weeks if not days after all he's turning one i heartily advise you to invest your money in something that when used daily can benefit him for the rest of his life i realize you're probably looking for toy ideas and that's why you posted your question in this forum but think about the impact books can have on this young boy's life think of the special opportunity you have to influence his early learning and foster his emergent reading skills picture yourself reading to him and the joyful moments you two can share exploring the pages of a book a book can be an everlasting gift and you can inscribe a special message within it creating a lasting memory for this boy i still have books that my aunt and uncle gave me when i was a child and i loved rediscovering the inscriptions they wrote me when i read the books again as an adult the single best way to help a child become a reader for life is to read to him you can make a huge difference in this boy's life by giving him books you're establishing that you value reading and literature and you're encouraging him to value the same most young children love to hear the cadence of someone else's voice reading aloud to a child can be calming instructive and just plain fun i advise you to look for books that rhyme or have a rhythmic pattern also pop up books and lift the flap
