question on an old barbie or one of her friends does anyone remember a doll that would grow and un grow breasts when you twisted the arm i remember something like that from maybe the late 's but maybe it was from another line of dolls i was thinking maybe it was skipper but just can't remember sounds silly but it was one of those random memories that popped into my head today i was explaining it to my daughter and we had a good laugh about it that is growing up skipper i always wanted her she was a normal doll and then you turned her arm and she grew and got boobs she was not very popular because when she turned into a young lady her clothes didn't fit right and moms did not want to buy two wardrobes for one doll it was great technology for the time way to go mattel Barbie Ruth Handler Aquarium (album) Piccolo Junior Saga American girl dolls Doll Sharon Tate Mattel Recurring South Park characters Cliff Richard The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Little Britain Aerial (dance move) G.I.
