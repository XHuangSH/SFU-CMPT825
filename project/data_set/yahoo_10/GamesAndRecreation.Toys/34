can u just take the recalled toys to toys r us or walmart to get ur money back or do u have to send it back to mattel scared wont get money or toys back if i send them in and did anyone return ones they bought before may i have a few we bought in april the stores don't want the toys back the only way you could probably return a toy directly to a store is if it was still in the original package and you had the original receipt basically fisher price and mattel in your case wants to handle this recall by mail and they are picking up the shipping and handling costs by sending a prepaid label for you to mail the affected toys back to them i highly recommend you visit the web page set up for the recall and use the help me determine if i own products affected feature or closely read the review recall announcement they will only compensate for toys that meet the criteria and insist you be the judge that all of their other toys are safe http www service mattel com us recall default asp recall id they advise parents not to throw away the toy or take it to the store where it was purchased because fisher price wants to make arrangements to properly dispose of the toys Intellivision United States Postal Service Gmail Wal-Mart Video game crash of 1983 The Apprentice 2 Internet fraud Commodore 64 HyperText Transfer Protocol PHP E-mail spam Common Unix Printing System Mattel Stock Visual Basic Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation Electronic Arts G.I.
