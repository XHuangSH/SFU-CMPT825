does any one now any rubik's cube algorithms i finished my rubiks cube and want to know an algorithm that when i finish the algorithm the cube will be back to normal i need one were itll take i unno times of doing the algorithm to return the cube back to being completed any answer apriciated but please keep the answers simple as u can im a noobie if u can great if not its ok still answer if u can again any question apriciated tnxxxxxxxxxxxxx try these directions http en wikibooks org wiki how to solve the rubik s cube Rubik's Cube Sudoku Speed cubing Halting problem Professor's Cube Rubik's Magic Lambda calculus Algorithm Quantum computer Computational complexity theory NP-complete Randomized algorithm Geometry Ern__ Rubik Complexity classes P and NP Binary search Puzzle Heuristic (computer science) Dogic Pi Boolean satisfiability problem Megaminx Subset sum problem Prime number Genetic algorithm Regular expression Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Routing Uniform Resource Locator Integer factorization Numerical analysis BPP Shor's algorithm Simplex algorithm N-puzzle Grover's algorithm Turing machine Quicksort Dynamic programming Collision detection Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Zillions of Games 200 (number) Analysis of algorithms Wiki Rabin-Karp string search algorithm Fischer Random Chess Polyomino Dijkstra's algorithm Orders of magnitude (numbers) Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm HyperText Transfer Protocol Expert system Magic cube classes G__del's incompleteness theorem Lego P-complete Minimax Computer puzzle game Marching cubes Modular exponentiation Cryptanalysis Exponentiation Maze PP (complexity) Many-worlds interpretation JavaServer Pages Graph theory Wikipedia C plus plus BitTorrent Domain Name System Binary GCD algorithm Square root Ackermann function Rhombicuboctahedron Search algorithm Number theory Toy Discrete cosine transform Route assignment Church___Turing thesis Euclidean algorithm Multiplication algorithm Polyhedron Mathematical game Public key infrastructure Computation Elementary arithmetic 1729 (number) Internet Relay Chat Word problem for groups Matrix (mathematics) SL (complexity) Pascal's triangle Eight queens puzzle Matiyasevich's theorem SAML Cognitive science
