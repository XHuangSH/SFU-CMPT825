how to tighten a rubik's cube i just got my rubik's cube today and the pieces are already pretty loosened up it's rather hard to turn the faces since the pieces always get disoriented and get stuck i later took the cube part and checked the center there is a small gap between several screws the sticks that are attached to the center don't know what they are called and the places of attachment this causes several center piece to protrude which may be the reason why the pieces are so loosely assembled is there a special way to tighten the screws i tried rotating it and pushing it in with pure force none worked it do rubik cubes a lot and if this is happening it is probably caused by one of these reasons you bought your cube at a dollar store so this was bound to happen you dropped it or done something to it your technique of doing a rubik cube isn't good something happen to it at the factory personally a loose cube is a good cube it allows me to do it fast i suggest buying a new cube if really can't use it try walmart madman Rubik's Cube Timpani Screw Drill bit Violin Megaminx Professor's Cube Poker jargon Lego Carburetor Earring Sudoku Ern__ Rubik Cube Professional wrestling holds Textile manufacturing Rhombicuboctahedron Dogic Upholstery Soma cube Point groups in three dimensions Backgammon Rubik's Magic Chuck (engineering) Motility Screwdriver Floyd Rose True Crime: Streets of LA Cube (film) Polyhedron Hand grenade Equine conformation Diablo II Anchor Baroque chess Hard disk Rotation Octahedral symmetry Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Milton H.
