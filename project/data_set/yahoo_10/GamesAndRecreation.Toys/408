do barbies and bratz dolls have a negative affect on girls self esteem i always played with barbies when i was smaller all my barbies had blonde hair and blue eyes i always would look at them and think i wanna look like that but of course i couldn't later i did get a barbie that resembled me more i liked her more than the others now they have the bratz dolls for little girls these dolls were heavy make up and skimpy clothes what is your take on all of this i played with barbies and i never dreamt about looking like a real barbie i always knew that barbie was just a doll not a role model i used to play that she was a housekeeper doing all her house chores and taking care of her children just like my mom and grandma do and just one day after seeing a real beauty contest on tv she was a beauty queen therefore she was just a reflection of what i saw around me if a girl gets a bad example from her mother perhaps her doll will 'act' that wrong way if people around her give her a good example her doll will act the right way Barbie Doll Characters of The Sandman Bratz Barbie Girl Destiny's Child Jon Secada Aquarium (album) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ruth Handler Sex doll American girl dolls Pitaten Napoleon Dynamite Kodocha The Sandman: A Game of You Love Hina main characters Barbi Benton Christina Aguilera The Witch (Buffy episode) Marilyn Monroe Homestar Runner Karen McDougal Cliff Richard Blythe W.I.T.C.H.
