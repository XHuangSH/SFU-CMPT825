scalping morally wrong i been looking for transformers bumblebee toys for awhile now i couldnt find them in toy stores week after week i went to amazon com and ebay surprisingly people have like or more the same toys and sell them for triple the price sometimes more i kinda feel sad for kids who play with toys have to deal with bs my questions are are scalping wrong morally are there anyway to fight these acts while scalping can hurt the intended market for a product it's not morally wrong it's all a matter of supply and demand if there is a short supply of a product and a high demand then people with access to the product are going to sell it for a high price because people are more willing to pay that price as long as people are willing to purchase an item for those prices 'scalpers' are going to continue to sell them for profit really the blame should be placed on the company for failing to produce enough units to meet demand and maximize their sales Supply and demand Amazon.com Bulk vending Internet fraud Sears Holdings Corporation Economics The Long Tail Wal-Mart Electronic commerce Microeconomics Pixar Lionel Corporation Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Protectionism ITunes Music Store Deflation (economics) Labor theory of value The Apprentice 2 Price discrimination Publishing Supermarket Law of value Prices of production RuneScape economy Neoclassical economics Monopoly Network effect Airline Dot-com Video game crash of 1983 Tariff Exchange value Keynesian economics Illegal drug trade Say's law Lionel, LLC Black market Commodity Pricing Inflation Loss leader Commodore International Monetary policy Arguments for and against drug prohibition Economy of Russia Day trading Tesco Free market Dollar store Technical analysis Gold as an investment Productive and unproductive labour MAME Ethical consumerism Profit maximization Externality Short selling My Little Pony Scalping 1973 oil crisis Mutual fund American individualist anarchism Great Depression Investment bank Hyperinflation Corporation Google Ford Motor Company Toys "R" Us Model (economics) Canadian and American economies compared Food and Drug Administration Value added tax American Flyer Progressive tax Gross domestic product Theory of conduct PlayStation 2 Contract Amway Criticisms of socialism Textbook Privatization Topps Auction Inventory PE ratio Utilitarianism Management information system Kyoto Protocol Grey market Steve Jobs G.I.
