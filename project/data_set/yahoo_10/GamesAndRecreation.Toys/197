how do i solve a rubix cube how do i solve one theirs some secret i want to know the method the petrus method has steps step build a x x corner step expand to x x step twist the edges or bad edges step finish layers step b tricks step position the corners complete step index step twist the corners complete step index step position the edges step block building tricks practice example solutions check this website this is a tutorial for my method of solving rubik's cube it is intended both for beginners and experienced cubers there is no group theory or strange notation involved i just show you how to move you very much need a java enabled browser http lar com cube Rubik's Cube Speed cubing Python programming language Professor's Cube JavaScript Exponentiation Ajax (programming) Spyware BitTorrent Rubik's Magic Genetic algorithm Computational complexity theory HyperText Transfer Protocol Algorithm Collision detection Web crawler Minesweeper (computer game) Eight queens puzzle Figurate number Violin Extreme Programming Cube (film) Skateboarding trick Scientology beliefs and practices Simplex algorithm Drill bit XML Traveling salesman problem Unified Modeling Language Complexity classes P and NP Java programming language Endgame Dogic Visual Basic Ruler-and-compass construction Contredanse Chess strategy and tactics Seismic retrofit Zeno's paradoxes Cryptanalysis Xiangqi Shogi Expert system Cube root Mozilla Firefox Guqin Pascal's triangle Ordinary differential equation Mathematics of general relativity Point groups in three dimensions Computer chess Chess terminology World Wide Web Professional wrestling attacks Glossary of American football Website Software engineering Wireless Application Protocol Substitution cipher SAML Linear programming Cluedo Reversi Partial differential equation JavaServer Pages Regular polytope Ethernet Liquid crystal Chess Objective-C Spamdexing RSA Timeline of mathematics Magic square Tai shogi Comparison of generics to templates Computer vision Figure skating Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Transmission Control Protocol Marching band Fischer Random Chess Transport Layer Security Cube Cellular automaton Polyhedron Conway's Game of Life Halting problem G__del's incompleteness theorem Time Cube Sorting algorithm ALGOL 68 Cascading Style Sheets Hexadecimal Domain Name System
