i have webkinz how do i make sure im giving each one enough attention accually i have about i just didnt want ti brag ok i no about the my pets but what should i do with it how should i divide my time you could play with one webkinz one day and the other webkinz another day or you can feed your pet and go to the arcade and play a couple of games then switch your pet and do something with that one you can still give quality time with each of your webkinz pets even if you have less than minutes but may i suggest that start off seeing the my pet's care section and see if you need to feed or take care of your pets hope i helped Pump It Up The Pet Sounds Sessions Digital pet Pet Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Neopets Tamagotchi Jim Carrey Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Pet Sounds Pinball Book of Isaiah Open access Hunter (World of Warcraft) Paintball Aladdin (1992 film) Falconry Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Pets.com Canada Health Act Good Vibrations Breastfeeding Zoo Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Rescue group Pet Shop Boys Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dance Dance Revolution Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Virgin Mobile MegaMan Battle Network 5 Domestic rabbit Video game music Pet store Super Bowl XXXIV Pet Shop of Horrors Infantilism High score Alex Ferguson Chicken Hamster 1957 World Series Prague Metro Clownfish ROM image The Joker's Wild Arcade game Final Fantasy XI Pet skunk Michael Owen Denis Law Blonde on Blonde Beetle LiveJournal PONG Bird Fanta Gatling gun Fancy rat Kasparov versus The World Gas metal arc welding Rubeus Hagrid Cognitive science Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMIX Penguin Xbox Live Grief PvP Wangan Midnight Pikmin Internet troll DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Animal husbandry Super Mario Bros.
