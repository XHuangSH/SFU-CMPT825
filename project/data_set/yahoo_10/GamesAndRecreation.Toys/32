hess trucks made in hong kong china what's the difference hello a family member gave me a few hess trucks to sell on ebay and i received a question asking if one was made in hong kong or china i know nothing about these trucks and was wondering what the difference was is one of more value if made in a certain place thanks it is possible the trucks were made in both locations and the trucks are identical in make however with some of the trucks the majority were made in hong kong while less were made in china so that would make the one from china worth a bit more Hong Kong, China at the 2004 Summer Olympics Politics of Hong Kong Hong Kong national football team Hong Kong dollar Economy of Hong Kong Hongkonger Cathay Pacific Cantonese (linguistics) Media in Hong Kong British nationality law Chinese surname Chief Executive of Hong Kong Mid-levels Hong Kong Film Awards Hong Kong Basic Law Battle of Hong Kong Hong Kong Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
