chinese product recall what products exactly are affected is it just fisher price affected by this chinese product recall or is it a whole range of baby items decided to see what stuff i have for my new baby that is made in china one item was a painted plastic dinnerware set the company it is made by is babycie com a company based in california so i sent them a very polite email asking if they knew for sure that this product was safe and he sent me back an email saying 'of course it is safe ' so am i supposed to just take his word for it the silly man obviously got very offended that i was asking but honestly does he think i am going to let my child eat off a plate that has paint with lead in it so i just emailed him back and asked how he could be so sure and who was his chinese vendor i suggested that if he was unable to confirm for sure that his products were safe then i would enlist the help of channel news to investigate instead does anyone know if its just fisher price affected or where i could get that info thanx i think you're wise to be concerned i certainly wouldn't trust him i advise you to consider removing all chinese made toys and other products from your home especially any item that your child uses regularly i hate to sound jingoistic but these people clearly do not have the same standards for quality control that we expect in america i am appalled a the rash of recalls we've seen recently involving products made in china here is a photo list of the fisher price toys the company has recalled in cooperation with the united states consumer products safety commission http service mattel com us recall ivr asp prod here is the official notice from the cpsc http service mattel com us recall ivr asp prod the cpsc is also the best place to go for information about other recalls including toys household products and electronics http www cpsc gov here is another toy that has been recalled recently can you guess where it was manufactured right china jeepers http www cpsc gov cpscpub prerel prhtml html Advance fee fraud HTML Plame affair Video game crash of 1983 Gmail Bicycle helmet Ajax (programming) Phishing E-mail spam Electronic commerce Intellivision The Standard Polyvinyl chloride People's Republic of China 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Television Internet fraud Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cross site scripting Teletext RFID Nintendo Entertainment System United States Postal Service Genetically modified food Bulk vending Mattel Theory of conduct Plame affair timeline Pharmaceutical company Bluetooth Internet censorship in mainland China Lionel Corporation World Wide Web America Online Character encodings in HTML Warez Website Food Speed limit Common Unix Printing System Airsoft Economy of the People's Republic of China Pretty Good Privacy Biodiesel Audiophile Common criticisms of Microsoft E-mail 2003 California recall M16 (rifle) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Web browser HTTP cookie DVD B3ta Video game publisher Digital photography Trademark Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Casting Roswell UFO incident Airbus A380 Sing Tao Daily Digital audio broadcasting SAML China Vehicle registration plate Internet Coal Mozilla Application Suite RuneScape cheats Thimerosal Web portal MMORPG Surveillance Amazon.com Offshoring Dinky Toy Commodore International David Blunkett Web server Scrabble Roller coaster Inflation Spyware ASP.NET Opera (web browser)
