question about starting a cell phone contract i'm and i want to get a cell phone of my own i don't have a credit card and never have therefore i don't have any credit built on my name can i still get a cell phone or would i have to build up good credit first you don't have to build credit to get a cell phone once you are you can go and get a contract just a couple things to keep in mind before you go decided what carrier you want the reason you will want to do this is because each major carrier runs a credit check on you you don't want to many people running credit checks on you effects your credit score anyway the company that usually has the lowest deposit if any is either t mobile or sprint figure out how much is too much for a deposit are you willing to pay more for a deposit or would you rather save that money for a good phone also do the research the companies price plans and extras text message internet usage etc so you know how much you are going to be paying a month also keep in mind that the first bill is going to be higher then what you will talk about with your sales rep because of activation fees and prorated charges like i said just a couple things to keep in mind now the good thing is that once you do get into a contract and pay your bill every month on time this will actually help build your credit in a good way Virgin Mobile Credit card Internet fraud Skype Verizon Wireless Insurance Bank Global System for Mobile Communications GSM services Solar cell Mutual fund Octopus card FairTax Mobile phone Automatic teller machine Microeconomics Short selling Mortgage Q-Telecom Voice over IP Short message service Social rule Telephone North American Numbering Plan E-mail spam Modem Filling station BlackBerry The Amazing Race Capitalism Payphone 9-1-1 Sprint Nextel Corporation Health insurance Citigroup London Congestion Charge Telephone numbering plan Islamic banking Bond General Packet Radio Service Food and Drug Administration Money Major League Baseball television contracts Tesco Electronic commerce T-Mobile Broadband Internet access Contract Micropayment Credit card fraud Taxation in the United States Public transport Internet Live 8 United Kingdom corporation tax Deflation (economics) Opera (web browser) Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Cruising (maritime) Phone sex Cheque Euro Satchel Paige Poker jargon Tom DeLay AT&T N-Gage U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 NEC Corporation Eircom Monetary policy Tax Phreaking Certificate of deposit Advance fee fraud Instant messaging Federal Standard 1037C Intellectual property Annuity Telephone tapping Electronic Arts Enron Corporation EFTPOS Education in Germany Slashdot subculture Economy of Russia Cellular network Minimum wage Hyperinflation Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
