hi wondering how to stop my samsung u from making an indicative sound anytime i send a text thanks i have gone through menu settings then sound settings to do this but there seems to be no way for me to customize my text settings so that i can send a text without it making some kind of indicative sound can anyone help me on this thanks the only thing that you can do is switch to silent vibrate or you can sort this if you mod with the latest firmware but its risky cos you will most probably kill the phone Verizon Wireless Embedded system Short message service Spam (electronic) Vorbis Virgin Mobile IPod Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Super Nintendo Entertainment System Palm OS PlayStation Portable Modem System/36 DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Morse Code System/34 Modchip Danger Hiptop IBM PC compatible Musical Instrument Digital Interface MSX Mod (computer gaming) Halo: Combat Evolved Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Private branch exchange Sin City Advance Wars: Dual Strike DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Telephone Hornbostel-Sachs Gmail Taxi Driver BlackBerry Mouse (computing) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME DVD MSN Messenger Diacritic DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Windows 2000 Mute (music) Counter-Strike Teletext Blur Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) GSM services Timpani Paul Is Dead Samsung Hangul Dual-tone multi-frequency Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Battlefield 2 Radio Civilization III Garry's Mod Phonon ZX Spectrum Search engine optimization Proto-Indo-European language Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Violin Unreal Tournament AFI 100 Years series Nintendo DS Flash memory Filling station Network Switching Subsystem Sonar Doom 3 Windows XP Warcraft III Stopping e-mail abuse Conspiracy (TNG episode) Sanskrit Huygens probe DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX 1 (number) Case modding The Sims 2 Mantra Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Integrated Services Digital Network SIGSALY Digital Acorn Electron Vertical service code Common Unix Printing System Modding United States Postal Service Unicode and e-mail Avalanche Anytime You Need a Friend SCART Communications protocol Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
