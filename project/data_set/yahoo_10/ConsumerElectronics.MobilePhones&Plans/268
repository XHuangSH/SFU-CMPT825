deleting data on mobile factory reset etc how can i delete the data on my phone and do a factory reset without really being able to access it i'm going to send it off to www mopay co uk and they prefer it if personal information is gone and it is restored to the factory settings problem is the sim cards blocked so i cant access the phone how can i restore it without access and without breaking it or damaging it at all cheers many phones do not allow you to access the phone content without a sim card inserted hence your first option is to get another sim card then use that to switch the phone on and resent the phone also check the manual as a few phones allow you to hard reset the phone in other ways just as a side point most phones use flash memory which even a full master reset on the phone does not leave your data as deleted it can still be recovered with specialist software in some cases my advice would be that if it's just a few personal photos and other basic stuff why bother as nothing untoward can be done with it by others accessing the data if it's got business or confidential data which you really want to protect don't send it to any third party firm as they'll no doubt be refurbishing it and reselling it abroad for profit and they are unlikely to do anything to clear the memory Bluetooth Windows 2000 The Sims 2 Telephone tapping Secure Digital card Embedded system Network Switching Subsystem GSM services Flash memory IPod Redundant array of independent disks Password Danger Hiptop Enterprise content management Data retention Skype Linked list Global System for Mobile Communications Identity theft Computer virus Read-only memory File system Floppy disk CPU cache Gmail Hard disk British national identity card Pirate decryption Java programming language Virtual memory Digital photography Commodore 64 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Mobile phone Data remanence Smart card EIA-708 Malware Telephone numbering plan Universal Serial Bus Hayes command set HTML element Trusted computing Classified information Windows XP Modchip Opera (web browser) Buffer overflow E-mail spam Virgin Mobile Diablo II: Lord of Destruction MDAC Plame affair Computer Spam (electronic) Wireless Application Protocol Verizon Wireless Hash table System/36 Computer security Expert system Wi-Fi Federal Standard 1037C Internet fraud Compiler optimization 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Customer relationship management Tungsten Handheld Atari 8-bit family Apollo Guidance Computer Neopets Linux ALGOL 68 X86 assembly language JavaScript Oscilloscope System/34 PDP-11 File Allocation Table Digital rights management Phishing Voice over IP Sega Saturn E-mail Objective-C Copy protection Internet Group Management Protocol Spyware Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act N-Gage Final Fantasy (video game) BlackBerry
