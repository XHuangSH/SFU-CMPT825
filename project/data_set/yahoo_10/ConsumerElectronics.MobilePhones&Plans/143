downloading music onto mobile from pc i recently bought a nokia which comes with a memory card onto which you should be able to save music i have music on my pc that i can play on media player or itunes but it doesn't save onto the memory card although the computer does read the card i get an error message i don't have a usb for it since nokia doesn't come with one do you think it would work better with that the same songs were copied to my mp without any problems please help i think the error msg was something like 'the file is disk protected' or something like that it was a week or two ago so i'm not entirely sure also i tried saving by inserting the memory card that comes inside the phone into it's adaptor and then inserting that into my laptop the comp recognised it since the device was visible on 'my computer' but nothing would get saved so basically i would need a usb cable u think rather than the memory card if the song is in mp format it should be fine it will not work if you are trying to take a song you purchased from itunes that requires the phone to be itunes capable which your phone is not you didn't say what the error message was or how you are trying to transfer the music you said you did not have the cable when you have a cable it is very simple the computer reads the phone as a mass storage device and you just drag the music you want to copy from the pc to the device IPod Floppy disk Universal Serial Bus Bluetooth USB flash drive Musical Instrument Digital Interface Hard disk PlayStation Portable ITunes Music Store Digital rights management Digital photography Digital audio player Computer bus USB mass storage device class PlayStation 2 Flash memory Memory Stick Windows XP Walkman PlayStation 3 Computer virus Apple Computer N-Gage Windows 2000 Commodore 64 ZX Spectrum Compact disc Symbian OS Windows Vista Computer Mobile phone System/36 Computer forensics AmigaOS Advanced Audio Coding Computer hardware Apple Macintosh Memory card MiniDisc SCSI Read-only memory Atari ST FairPlay IPod shuffle Digital camera Television File Allocation Table Dongle Digital video recorder Copy protection Apple II family System/34 Sound recording Nokia Online music store Personal computer Linux Video game music IMac Podcasting Creative Zen Modem Laptop Opera (web browser) FireWire Gramophone record Windows Mobile We Belong Together Virtual memory E-mail Karaoke Punch card RS-232 History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) BlackBerry Xbox IBM PC History of computing hardware Linux kernel Booting Password Commodore International Computer storage C programming language Tungsten Handheld
