is t mobile a good cell provider in new york state pls weigh in after a bad break up with verizon they refuse to credit me for services i asked them to take off numerous times but never did i ended up with t mobile because of their great rates and promises that the service works in my area of new york i live in the hudson valley area i have another days before i am permanently locked into my contract but am wondering how new yorkers feel about the service so far it seems ok but i get a lot of dropped calls indoors malls stores my job and i have seen some past reviews that were not that great hidden charges bad cust service etc but they were from and before i am assuming they have change a lot since t mobile is a new cell company here so any reviews are appreciated thanks for your help t mobile works on a higher frequency than either att or verizon so their will be a couple of differences first the calls are generally much clearer on t mobile second the signal does not penetrate walls or building the same as lower frequencies do so there will be areas where the old service works and t mobile does not however t mobile also has just released a wi fi phone that will allow you to connect to a wireless router wherever one is available and your calls are free very cool compromise ask a store rep about it overall i think you will be happy good luck Global System for Mobile Communications Verizon Wireless Telephone Cellular network Verizon Communications AT&T Wi-Fi Telephone numbering plan General Packet Radio Service Vodafone Code division multiple access Diode Advanced Mobile Phone System Bluetooth GSM services Voice over IP North American Numbering Plan Sprint Nextel Corporation Virgin Mobile N-Gage Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing 9-1-1 IEEE 802.11 CDMA2000 Mobile phone Cingular Wireless IP Multimedia Subsystem T-Mobile Hydrogen economy Global Positioning System Electrophysiology Octopus card Password Federal Standard 1037C Telephone tapping Antenna (radio) UK telephone numbering plan Mobile phone radiation and health Taxicab IS-95 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Emergency telephone number Nordic Mobile Telephone BlackBerry Beatmania IIDX Surveillance Broadband Internet access Telephone booth Radio TELUS Nuclear magnetic resonance Solar cell America Online Push to talk Battery (electricity) MTR Skype Oscilloscope Cable television Action potential Network Switching Subsystem Tank Microeconomics Toll-free telephone number WiMAX DVD Filling station Transistor Wireless access point Cordless telephone Central processing unit Transformer Electromagnetic spectrum Modem Canadian Pacific Railway Radio clock Galileo spacecraft Wireless Application Protocol Amateur radio Sears Holdings Corporation Circuit design Digital audio broadcasting Communications satellite Asynchronous Transfer Mode Insurance Labor theory of value Wireless LAN Loudspeaker Tesla coil Digital photography Wall Street Universal Serial Bus NorthwesTel Digital Subscriber Line Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Television PlayStation 3 Cruising (maritime)
