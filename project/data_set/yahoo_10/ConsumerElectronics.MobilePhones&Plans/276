how long can a mobile phone last for under water before it stops working i'm curious as to how long can a mobile phone last for under water before it completely stops working there's two parts to this water is a good conductor of electricity therefore if it's all over the pcb printed circuit board and chip surfaces inside when turned on the electrical signals will short immediately and the phone is likely to stop working if you immerse the phone in water then dry it out completely the oxidisation process will leave crystalised residue all over the components inside and destroy any chance of it working however i have seen phones quickly immersed in water when dropped and then dried out which still work but it's very unlikely and not something to try especially as even a small amount of steam can water damage a phone if you open the back of phones and take off the battery many have a small white disc which changes colour when wet permanently to enable repair centres to identify if it's not working due to water damage which is not covered under most warranties Printed circuit board Circuit design Thermal power station Transformer Drill bit PCB layout guidelines Toyota Prius Soldering Capacitor GSM services Mobile phone Floppy disk Tesla coil Casting Drowning Sulfuric acid USB flash drive Telephone USS Waters (DD-115) USS Tunny (SS-282) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Microphone Oscilloscope Rail terminology Vacuum tube Naval mine Disc brake Second Battle of the Atlantic Modem Sewage treatment Solar cell Electrical wiring Internal combustion engine Water (molecule) Residual-current device Poker jargon Carbon dioxide Transmitter Diode Jack plug Dry cleaning Transistor Internal ballistics Semiconductor device Action potential Battery electric vehicle USS Anderson (DD-411) Electrical generator Diving suit Sento Gramophone record Ball grid array Renewable energy Antenna (radio) USS Taylor (DD-468) Diving Universal Serial Bus Iowa class battleship Read-only memory USS Wasp (CV-18) Volt Tire USS Walke (DD-723) Glossary of firefighting equipment Digital circuit Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Wind turbine Phreaking Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fire extinguisher High-voltage hazards Surface-mount technology Unterseeboot 505 Railway signalling USS Ammen (DD-527) NEC Corporation USS Alfred A.
