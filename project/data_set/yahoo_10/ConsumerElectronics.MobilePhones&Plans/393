can somebody tell me of a good pre pay cell provider any ideas who 'dbe better all of the major cell companies offer some kind of pre paid option i myself have been on the cingular at t plan for quite some time even though i like the celection of phones that they have their use is limited due to the type of chip that the pre paid service uses if you're looking for good solid service with options cingular at t isn't bad the only problem that i have with them is that text messages are cents per regardless of sending or receiving also they charge for the air time it takes to check a voice mail if you're looking for a solid network i'd recommend verizon they really do have the best network nationwide they say that verizon spends millions of dollars every few months on the network they're serious i have heard varrying opinions on the phones and customer service though stay away from t mobile i used them for my first cell phone and got rid of it in relatively short order the phone didn't work the customer service wasn't very good and it generally wasn't a pleasant experience sprint nextell is hit or miss when you have a signal the phones are great i've heard different opinions on customer service though what it comes down to is what is important to you and how much talk time you're looking for if all you want is a really cool phone then one provider might work better if you want great service it may be a little more expensive don't be afraid to do your own research and good luck Verizon Wireless Sprint Nextel Corporation BlackBerry Verizon Communications Cingular Wireless Global System for Mobile Communications AT&T T-Mobile Universal Mobile Telecommunications System GSM services Broadband Internet access Telephone Vodafone Short message service Mobile phone Voice over IP Push to talk Directory assistance Toll-free telephone number SBC Communications North American Numbering Plan Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Code division multiple access Cable television 9-1-1 Poker jargon Advanced Mobile Phone System Cellular network Gmail Modem General Packet Radio Service W-CDMA Bluetooth Speech recognition United States Postal Service MSN Messenger Telephone numbering plan Public transport Social rule CDMA2000 Radio E-mail spam Mach kernel Musical Instrument Digital Interface Videotex Evolution Data Only CompuServe American Red Cross IS-95 Teletext Nordic Mobile Telephone Telephone tapping Phone sex Surveillance Skype Network Switching Subsystem Morse Code Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insurance Filling station MCI Mergers and acquisitions Wireless Application Protocol American Idol Direct marketing Vertical service code United Parcel Service IP Multimedia Subsystem Japanese mobile phone culture Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
