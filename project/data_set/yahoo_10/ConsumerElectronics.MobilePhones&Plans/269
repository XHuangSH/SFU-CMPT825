sony ericsson k i and calls im having difficulties with my phone sony ericsson k i ive found that it wont show me any body's number that i have missed their calls and wont show me who i have called either whenever i miss a call then instead of my phone showing who's call i have missed it goes straight to shortcuts can any one help me im getting rather frustrated with the thing might seem strange but have you tried taking the battery out for a few seconds then replacing it i had a w i for years and on occasion it would go loopy but that always seemed to do the trick if not might be best to exchange it for a new one if poss good luck Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB Ericsson Walkman Symbian OS KaBlam!
