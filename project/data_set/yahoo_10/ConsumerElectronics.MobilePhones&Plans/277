number for texting to the philippines i have been trying to text my friend who is currently on holiday in the philippines i am stupid enough to only just realise that i need to put a code number infront of her mobile number for her to receive the text e g say her number was then i would need to put some number like for her to get the text but i dont have a clue what the few digits are i have looked and cant find it anywhere so i was wondering does anyone know what the number is bearing in mind that i am in england and i have an english phone and she has an english phone and how do you use it e g what do i type into the number box thing do i use a space between the numbers do i use a do i use nothing i dont have a clue thanks for reading and any answers would be much appreciated lmn x x i did email her about a week ago but she hasnt replied so she's either annoyed with me for some strange reason or its because of the recent flooding and storms and could have cut off the electricity if she is still using her uk sim she will be charged for receiving a text from abroad i e england if she has purchased a local sim to use in her phone then she will have a totally different number anyway the code for phillipines is so if her number in uk is you would need to dial the first zero in the national number is always left out for an international call UK telephone numbering plan Telephone numbering plan Short message service Toll-free telephone number North American Numbering Plan GSM services Telephone number 9-1-1 Mobile phone Social rule Emergency telephone number Telephone Voice over IP Gmail National Weather Service Oplan Bojinka Virgin Mobile Morse Code Dial M for Murder Shaggy dog story ZIP Code Telephone exchange Blue box Phreaking Telephone tapping Network Switching Subsystem International Mobile Equipment Identity Johnny 5 Argentine telephone numbering plan Contemporary culture of South Korea BlackBerry Time Out of Mind Surveillance Paul Is Dead Billboard (advertising) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue EastEnders Musical Instrument Digital Interface We Belong Together Caller ID Global System for Mobile Communications Internet fraud 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Jumpstart 3rd Grade Unicode Joke Plame affair Data retention Predictive dialer Rose (Doctor Who) Speech synthesis Country code Digital photography The Inside The Sims Bluetooth Philippines American and British English differences Whois Roswell UFO incident Make money fast Modem Crossword Simplified Chinese character The Sims 2 Vertical service code Neighbours International Mobile Subscriber Identity Anonymous remailer Little Britain Spam (electronic) The Amazing Race Digital Subscriber Line Rotary dial Electronic Arts Anne Rice Japanese mobile phone culture Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tag Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Chinglish Tesco Radio British national identity card Dilbert Homer Simpson Killian documents Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Billboard Hot 100 Q-Telecom United Airlines Flight 93 Verizon Wireless Friends United States Postal Service The writing of Principia Mathematica Slashdot subculture Good News Week World War Three (Doctor Who) Page widening
