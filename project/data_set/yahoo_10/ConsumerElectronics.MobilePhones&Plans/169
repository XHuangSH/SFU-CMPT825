is there any way to get of a mobile phone contract without the penalties or am i stuck yeah unfortunately you are stuck with the contract the only way to get out of it is if you moved to a new area and there is no signal or service provided by your carrier or if you die and telling them that you lost your phone or that it broke will not get you out of the contract either if you can no longer afford your line then you can try to ask someone else to take it over for you and transfer the contract to them if you just want to leave the carrier and go to another one then you will still have to pay the fee if you want a new phone and can t because you are still under contract you can always add a line to your account but that would mean a new contract you are normally put under a contract because the wireless company subsidies the price of the phone the retail price of the phone might be but because you are a new customer or you upgraded you got to buy the phone for or depending on your wireless company the early termination fee could be anywhere between sorry Verizon Wireless Telephone North American Numbering Plan Voice over IP Virgin Mobile Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Global System for Mobile Communications Cable television T-Mobile Telephone numbering plan Modem NorthwesTel Vodafone Eircom AT&T Insurance Sprint Nextel Corporation Telephone exchange Wireless Application Protocol Cingular Wireless N-Gage Q-Telecom BlackBerry Cellular network United States Postal Service Rogers Communications Ryanair TiVo MTR General Packet Radio Service Telstra Microeconomics Public transport Verizon Communications Enhanced 911 Wi-Fi EFTPOS Stock Toll-free telephone number WiMAX Telecom New Zealand Private branch exchange Octopus card Leasing Universal Serial Bus ITunes Music Store UK telephone numbering plan Wireless network Filling station NEC Corporation Electronic commerce Airline Radio IP Multimedia Subsystem Denis Law Integrated Services Digital Network Bluetooth Mobile phone Best Buy Vertical service code Telegraphy ALLTEL Wal-Mart NTT DoCoMo Annuity Phreaking Local exchange carrier GSM services Turkcell SBC Communications United Airlines Telephone company Telephone tapping Internet Value added tax 9-1-1 Internet fraud Gmail Videotex Nortel Networks United Parcel Service Qwest Health insurance Advance fee fraud IEEE 802.11 IiNet IPAQ Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Opera (web browser) Outsourcing Network Switching Subsystem BT Group plc Euro ITV Code division multiple access
