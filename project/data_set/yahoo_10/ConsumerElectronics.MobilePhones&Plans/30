whats better the samsung d or the samsung u i'm thinking of buying a new phone either the samsung d or the samsung u so can anyone tell me which is better why is it better what is the best pay as you go network to get the phone on i asked a couple people that question and they said the d because the u has problems with pictures i think t mobile is a better out fit because they are cheaper and the customer service is better if you don't already have an account with t mobile i suggest you go through this company because all the major cell phone companies have partnered up with them because they are competing for everyone's business you can purchase a cheaper phone and they'll put you on a plan that best suits what you want not the carrier i went looking for a black berry phone through the carriers store as well as their web site the phone was going to cost me close to and they were going to put me on a plan for someone referred me to this company and i received the same phone for and was put on the same plan for so they saved me quite a bit of money i strongly suggest you call them up their direct line is ask them to put you on the myfaves or you can check out their web site at www tiffanyvague acnrep com good luck Virgin Mobile Verizon Wireless Electronic commerce Tesco Surveillance Sprint Nextel Corporation Private branch exchange Telephone tapping Voice over IP Universal Mobile Telecommunications System T-Mobile GSM services Vodafone North American Numbering Plan CompuServe AT&T Mobile phone Telephone Wireless Application Protocol Flash memory Modem Delta Air Lines Insurance Octopus card Wal-Mart Enterprise content management Internet fraud Teletext Taxicab Samsung MSN Messenger Data retention Global System for Mobile Communications Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Health insurance Outsourcing Opera (web browser) 9-1-1 TELUS Mobile phone radiation and health Telephone number Skype NorthwesTel Filling station Computer Citigroup Ryanair United Airlines Flight 93 Short message service Internet America Online Monopoly (game) WiMAX ITunes Music Store TransUnion Stock United Parcel Service United States Postal Service EFTPOS Q-Telecom Eircom Airline Orange SA Best Buy Digital Subscriber Line Symbian OS Digital photography Toll-free telephone number Phone fraud General Packet Radio Service N-Gage Nokia Monopoly SCO-Linux controversies The Amazing Race IiNet I-mode Austar Bluetooth Live 8 Year 2000 problem EasyGroup Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition Air New Zealand Advanced Mobile Phone System Camera phone E-mail spam Warren Buffett Gross domestic product Cable television One.Tel Mortgage DeviantART Timeline of the Enron scandal
