iphone how long do you think it will take for the iphone to be or less and have no bugs and sold without a contract the iphone is not likely to be reduced in price for the next months the iphone is an amazing phone well worth the purchase i have been using the iphone since june th and just can't get enough of it i recall saying that if the iphone was half as good as the ads show it to be it would be incredible i am happy to report that the iphone is as good if not better than what was shown in ads almost every day i find something new i can do with it or a new feature while there are some shortcomings no device would ever be perfect the iphone is truly an amazing device and i think that just about anyone would love it pros compact revolutionary and easy touch screen interface easy to use quick access to every feature beautiful screen easy to read even in direct sunlight cool and intuitive graphical user interface gui ipod video ipod web browsing e mail and phone all in one easy e mail access from multiple accounts you can get e mails from yahoo gmail and many other accounts allows viewing of various attachments e g pdf google maps and driving directions make finding places and adding to your contact list a snap great widely used applications stocks weather maps youtube ipod etc built in wifi zoomzoomzoom fast fast fast features can be updated via a simple sync feels solid metal like scratch resistent screen although i would recommend getting a screen protector fairly good phone quality cons gb or gb may be too small storage capacity for those people who want to carry all of their music and some videos with them although psychologically either capacity sounds too low in reality even the gb version would be more than enough for those folks wanting only a segment of their song listings over songs if you max out the gb or put a couple of full version movies and about or so songs or any number of combination may be just enough for many if not most users no physical keyboard the keyboard is accessed on the screen and would take a few days to get adjusted to can't attach files in e mail although you can forward attachment you receive on the iphone via e mail can't save images that were sent via e mail can't open certain attachements e g ms office etc can't change position of icons and info stocks weather this will most likely be changed via software update from apple can't change ring profiles on the fly this will most likely be changed via software update from apple no drag and drop capability can't download pics to use as wallpaper unless its from the camera email doesn't switch layout from horizontal to vertical like the safari web browser does this will most likely be changed via software update from apple no back button have to always press the home button for the main menu can't download additional ringtones this will most likely be changed via software update from apple third party apps can only be accessed via the safari web browser this can also be a good thing as it protects the phone from issues relating to installing applications on a device no sd card expansion slot you have to sync to get music videos podcasts uses the slower edge network instead of g network this can also be a plus as g would suck battery life camera does not take videos no flash screen smudges easily i highly recommend getting a screen protector no adobe's flash support this will most likely be changed via software update from apple battery is not user replaceable and would cost to send to apple for replacement can't use bluetooth stereo headphones this will most likely be changed via software update from apple if you use your computer mostly for e mail and some web browsing and are looking for an amazing phone that will allow you receive send e mail browse the web and have the best of ipod and video ipod then the iphone is for you although it is costly for the gb version and for the gb version the phone offers the best of all worlds when it comes to multi functional mobile device although there is a rumour of a smaller nano like version of iphone with less functionality as the original iphone coming out later this year in the u s a new version of the full featured iphone are unlikely to be released in the u s market until mid the european version of the iphone offered for the g network much faster than the at t's edge network is slated to be released by the end of the year SAS System Enterprise content management Java programming language Webmail ZX Spectrum Nintendo Entertainment System Scalable Vector Graphics Comparison of web browsers Microsoft Office PC Engine Gramophone record Python programming language Cascading Style Sheets PowerBook DVD Password
