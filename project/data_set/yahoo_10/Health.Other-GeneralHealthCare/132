can u phsyically see teenage boys grow in there sleep or even woman see somthing growing like there arms legs are trunk or even facial change cause im going through the final stage and i think it would be cool if i could see myself grow like my face i find it interesting so if i did it would there be any thing i could notice like quickly or no im talking like somthing easy to see and not my penis obviously not so u think if i record me sleeping u think i could visually see somthing as far as facial hair is concerned well if you shave often and your hair grows back quickly like over night then im sure that you could see it on camera but i dont think standing in the mirror waiting to see something is going to make it come you have to be well rested so that your mind can relax and your hormones can flow otherwise if you stand there waiting for a result all you will basically see in a tired individual and not what you expected also its not a rapid growth its something that takes time Puberty Baldness Prostate cancer Beard Parade (military) Sleep Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hair Pubic hair Social rule Sexual attraction The Amazing Race Vegeta Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaving Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Haircut Oral sex Narcolepsy Urinary incontinence Gay slang Depilation Testosterone Orgasm Shaggy dog story The Inside Goatse.cx 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Apollo 8 Sexual differentiation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Strap-on dildo Jam (TV series) Mr. T Spice Girls Fight Club Paul Is Dead Datalore (TNG episode) Motion capture Volleyball Equine conformation Baldness treatments Kodocha W.I.T.C.H.
