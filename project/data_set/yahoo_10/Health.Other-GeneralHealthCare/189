crackling in ears and back of neck for awhile now i've had this crackling sensation going on in my ears as well as the back of my neck when i move my head i can hear it and when i swallow and open my mouth all the way my ears crackle too sometimes i can even feel it going on in the back of my head wasn't sure if it was sinus ear infection or what but before it happened my left ear was hurting bad and now they're both hurting every now and then and i'll get some ringing i kind of feel some pressure going on in there didn't know if it was swimmers ear cause i went swimming about a month ago or perhaps from work because i work around airplanes and didn't have my earplugs in while one was starting up and felt like my eardrum was gonna pop can anyone rule this out or give me some pointers i would recommend going to the doctor for a formal analysis of your condition i believe it probably an ear problem perhaps wax build up or an ear infection your ears are very sensitive and important so you should definitely get checked out by a health professional Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Diving Otitis externa Ear Traumatic brain injury Swimming Dog Balance disorder Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Breastfeeding Reflexology Body piercing Earwax Aerial (dance move) Ear canal Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Headphones Oral sex The Shining (film) Pitaten Chronic fatigue syndrome Pneumonia M__ni__re___s disease Snake Otitis media Decibel Hearing impairment Medicine Drowning The Contender (television series) Breaststroke Stethoscope Professional wrestling holds First aid Snap, Crackle and Pop Cancer of the larynx Theory of conduct Stuttering Cabin pressurization Common cold Labrador Retriever Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blood on the Tracks Professional wrestling attacks Hyperbaric oxygen therapy It's All Gone Pete Tong Guinea pig Noonan syndrome Hip fracture Cat Till Lindemann Tinnitus Earring Gastroesophageal reflux disease Time Out of Mind Nine Inch Nails Jala neti Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tasmanian Devil Pet Sounds Childbirth Stomach cancer Front crawl Psychoacoustics Butterfly stroke Psoriasis Transactional analysis Massage Milton H.
