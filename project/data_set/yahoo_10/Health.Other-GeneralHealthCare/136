i stop breathing and jerk myself awake right when i fall asleep what should i do sounds like you have slep apnoea possibly you need to see your doc for sure obstructive sleep apnoea osa is defined as the cessation of airflow during sleep preventing air from entering the lungs caused by an obstruction these periods of 'stopping breathing' only become clinically significant if the cessation lasts for more than seconds each time and occur more than times every hour osa only happens during sleep as it is a lack of muscle tone in your upper airway that causes the airway to collapse during the day we have sufficient muscle tone to keep the airway open allowing for normal breathing when you experience an episode of apnoea during sleep your brain will automatically wake you up usually with a very loud snore or snort in order to breathe again people with osa will experience these wakening episodes many times during the night and consequently feel very sleepy during the day they have an airway that is more likely to collapse than normal osa can range from very mild to very severe the severity is often established using the apnoea hypopnoea index ahi which is the number of apnoeas plus the number of hypopnoeas per hour of sleep hypopnoea being reduction in airflow an ahi of less than is not likely to be associated with clinical problems to determine whether you are suffering from sleep apnoea you must first undergo a specialist 'sleep study' this will usually involve a night in hospital where equipment will be used to monitor the quality of your sleep the results will enable a specialist to decide on your best course of treatment the ultimate investigation is polysomnography which will include electro encephalography eeg brain wave monitoring electromyography emg muscle tone monitoring recording thoracic abdominal movements chest and abdomen movements recording oro nasal airflow mouth and nose airflow pulse oximetry heart rate and blood oxygen level monitoring electrocardiography ecg heart monitoring sound and video recording this is a very expensive investigation with few centres able to offer it routinely for all suspected sleep apnoea patients a 'mini' sleep study is more usual consisting of pulse oximetry and nursing observation home sleep study is becoming more popular osa is the commonest form of sleep apnoea about of men and of women but there is also a condition called central sleep apnoea csa this is a condition when the brain does not send the right signals to tell you to breathe when you are asleep in other words the brain 'forgets' to make you breathe it can also be associated with weakness of the breathing muscles the assessment for csa is often more complicated than for osa and the treatment has to be carefully matched to the patient's requirements there is also a condition called mixed sleep apnoea that is a combination of both obstructive and central sleep apnoea go ring your doc and make an app and good luck but remember if it is this once diagnosed you lose your drivers license but that is better than losing your life Emphysema Medicine Cancer Insomnia Chronic fatigue syndrome Out-of-body experience Cephalic disorder Clinical depression Atrial fibrillation Shock Atherosclerosis Insulin Acute respiratory distress syndrome Lung cancer Decompression sickness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dialysis Neurofeedback General anaesthesia Diabetes mellitus Cardiac arrhythmia Multiple sclerosis Hypnosis Weight training Tobacco smoking Prostate cancer Angina Ventricular fibrillation Aortic dissection Death Electroconvulsive therapy Myasthenia gravis Diazepam Migraine Hypertension Respiratory system Folic acid Cardiac arrest Electrocardiogram Chlorpromazine Terri Schiavo Pulmonary embolism Triage Psychosis Stomach cancer Eye Group A streptococcal infection Fuel injection Equine conformation Methamphetamine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Puberty Syringomyelia 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Rebreather Pneumothorax Coronary heart disease Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Growth hormone treatment Physical therapy Panic attack Sickle-cell disease Acupuncture Poliomyelitis Cardiovascular disease Allergy Radiation therapy Hip fracture Lucid dreaming Autism Motor neurone disease Blood pressure Cystic fibrosis
