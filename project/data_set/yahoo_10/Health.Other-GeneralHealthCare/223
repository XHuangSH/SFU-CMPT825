head lice please help k well i got head lice and i have very thick hair and now its hard to take them out my moms brushing them with thsi speacial comb or something but i have too many what should i do my moms planning to cut my hair right now at my house cuz we think that the hairstylist wont cut hair that has lice in it and then my mom got the shampoo for lice and im going to put it in my hair after i cut it and do u think it will hopefully get out i mean school is about to start and i cant have lice in my hair and also on wednesday im going to chicago to hang out with my cousins so i cant have lice please if u ahve any advice i need it thanks ive never tried this but they say it works you can buy a shower cap and put mayoniase all over your hear you have to cover everything scalp ends every bit of hair because the vinegar suffocates them but if you leave an empty spot they will all go to that spot it might also work with olive oil or a thick conditioner and your hair has to be fully in the cap or they will crawl all over your body and thats just bleh anyways after you have had the showercap on for a while you need wash it out in the shower and they will all be dead so they will fall out im not sure if the eggs will fall out but the bugs will so you may need to pick the eggs afterward in the meantime try to get out as many eggs as you can because every egg you take out is one less bug also use the comb and lice shampoo at the same time if you just pick alot everyday they should be gone in about days Dandruff Head louse Crab louse Haircut Shampoo Pediculosis Clothing Psoriasis Dreadlocks Sento Louse Baldness Neighbours Kodocha Babe Ruth Pubic hair RuneScape quests Depilation Shark Comb Textile manufacturing Teen Girl Squad Tick Poker jargon Tarantula Phoebe Buffay's songs Baldness treatments The Ark in Space Head Ocean's Twelve Dr. Seuss Act Without Words II Sushi Insect Leather Chicken Professional wrestling holds The Inside Tag Columbine High School massacre Diseases of the honeybee Comanche Mario Mohawk hairstyle Drill bit Headgear 2005 World Series Beard Cleveland Browns Paint 613 mitzvot The Marshall Mathers LP The Cursed Videotape My Little Pony The Empty Child Split Enz Stem cell A Simple Plan Kim Possible Minor Harry Potter Beasts Lou Gehrig American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Norway national football team Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Afro textured hair Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Mayonnaise Otitis externa Toronto Raptors Buffalo Bills Paul Is Dead Autopsy Rocky Mountain spotted fever Cosmetology Indianapolis 500 Brush Little Britain Daylight saving time Charmed Lou Rawls Erogenous zone Hormone replacement therapy (trans) National Football League Lou Boudreau Xenomorph Aloe Massage Conspiracy (TNG episode) Hypertrichosis Kenny McCormick Meat Loaf Breakfast Equine conformation Niddah Team Rocket Xiaolin Showdown
