does anyone know this about ethics i would like to know the details on the rules about nurses not being able to date there patients how long has it been in place is there a time frame for when it no longer applies to the patient after he is discharged or is it indefinite and any other useful info you think i should know i am just curious about this i don't know any nurses i want to date but i have like years ago i just remembered someone told me they could lose there job if they were caught so maybe that place was just more strict or just giving me bs nurse's generally don't date their patients because it can be confusing for the patient the patient can put the nurse in an idol position because they were there to comfort when you were sick it can be difficult also to see this person in a different light when you know such intimate details of their life it's not to say that i don't know nurses who have dated their patients but it's few and far between Nursing Medical record Plame affair Nurse Social rule Palliative care Milton H.
