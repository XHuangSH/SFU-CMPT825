i wake up and can't feel my arm this has happened to me about within a couple of months including this morning what happen is that i wake up in the morning and i basically can't feel my arm it feels really weird and i can't describe how it feels but it isn't good i hit my arm on my leg but i still can't feel it even if i pinch it really hard but if i start shaking it really fast my arm after a while it kinda goes back to normal and feels normal too this really scares me and i was wondering does anybody know why this happens thanks you slept with your hand under your pillow which slowed down the blood flow then your arm goes numb it's pretty common for me when you shake your arm a couple times it gets the flow going and you start feeling your arm again Blood on the Tracks Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Fast bowling 2000 Australian Grand Prix Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q Swingout Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Professional wrestling holds Out-of-body experience The Shining (film) Cliff Richard Milton H.
