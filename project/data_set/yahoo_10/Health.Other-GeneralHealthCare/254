stingy rash last saturday i wore some fairly tight jeans now i don't know if this has anything to do with it but throughout the day i became more and more uncomfortable when i took off my jeans later that night i noticed several large bumps on my stomach and left side i also found two little rows on my back they look a bit like bug bites but are really close together the patch on my tummy consists of about and the one on my side and the two rows on my back are just two bites each but right next to each other the thing about this rash is that it doesn't just itch it burns sometimes i'll get stinging pain with it like little needles poking right through the skin it's insane and nothing seems to help i've tried calamine lotion benadryl triple antibiotics alchohol wipes and aveeno anti itch all things that i've had good luck with in the past but not this time so i'm wondering what on earth could this be well it sounds like it could be shingles how old are you shingles is usually seen in older people and up but can be seen in younger adults and up if you lived in texas i would ask if you had red ants in your clothes but usually you feel them bite shingles produce a stinging pain and an itch and can become very bothersome this rash may be nothing serious but i suggest you see your physician if nothing you tried helped the pain then you will need something prescription strength if it is shingles you doctor will probably prescribe something to get rid of the shingles but will give you some pain medication to get you through until they are gone good luck hope it goes away soon Psoriasis Scabies Eczema Stomach cancer Cephalexin Cellulitis Fecal incontinence Herpes zoster Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Lyme disease Allergy Rash Conjunctivitis Mosquito Spider Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lupus erythematosus Chlorpromazine Marilyn Monroe Diving Sunburn Social rule Animal Crossing Conspiracy (TNG episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Tattoo Poker jargon Characters in the Smurfs Beetle in an Anthill Characters of Naruto Milton H.
