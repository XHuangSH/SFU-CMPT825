can i ask my doc to correct what he wrote in my medical records my doctor noted in my file that i was bi polar upon me telling him that there was no diagnosis from another doctor just me verbalizing it since then i have found out that my diagnosis is in fact different than that and not nearly as bad is there anything i can do to alter this considering this can affect me from an insurance standpoint among other things i don't really want an addendum either i really want it removed is this possible chasn's answer is correct in most states this process is regulated by law for example in my state a patient has the right to insist on an addendum to object to or clarify specific information the doctor's office is required to send the addendum whenever the note s to which it applies are sent to an insurer or other authorized requester however erasing the medical record which actually belongs to the doctor not the patient is strictly prohibited on an encouraging note you shouldn't have any insurance difficulties since you've now obtained a correct diagnosis especially if the diagnosing provider's records refutes the notion that you were bipolar in the past i hope this helps Prostate cancer Chiropractic Bipolar disorder Contract Transsexuality Psychiatry Terri Schiavo Expert system Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Health insurance Stomach cancer Insurance Diagnosis Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Medical record Medical prescription Involuntary commitment Appeal Pharmaceutical company Scientology beliefs and practices Alternative medicine Homeopathy Cancer Adult attention-deficit disorder Plame affair Schizophrenia Mental Health Act 1983 Copyright Physician Legal aspects of transsexualism Probation officer Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Psychosis Epilepsy Emergency Medical Services Mental illness Asperger syndrome Stroke Abortion Myocardial infarction Patent application Hypnosis Church of Christ, Scientist OpenDocument HIPAA Osteopathy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Indian nationality law Multiple sclerosis Mesothelioma Clinical depression Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Asthma Turner syndrome Persistent vegetative state Juris Doctor Hypoglycemia Dissociative identity disorder Science Government involvement in the Terri Schiavo case Endometriosis Fibromyalgia Traumatic brain injury Abortion debate Crohn's disease Medical malpractice Australian constitutional law Transformation problem Information Technology Infrastructure Library Euthanasia Cornelia Rau Deconstruction Alcoholics Anonymous Parkinson's disease Controlled Substances Act Chronic fatigue syndrome Borderline personality disorder Divorce Drug abuse Pneumonia Osteoarthritis American Medical Association Hearsay Constitution Allergy Philosophy of science Barbara Boxer United States Constitution Life insurance Traditional Chinese medicine Abortion in the United States
