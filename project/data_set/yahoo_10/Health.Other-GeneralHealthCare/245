blister problem ok so i have a blister on the heel of each of my feet one already popped and hurts really badly does anyone know ways to make them stop hurting also is there any way for the un ''popped'' one to not ''pop'' and still go away thanx a bunch first of all if it was a pair of shoes that caused the blisters don't wear them for a while if you can wear shoes that don't have a heel like sandals or clogs the easiest thing to put on them is some antibiotic ointment like neosporin or bacitracin and a non stick bandage there are also some bandages on the market that have a gel pad in them that you can use these would also help but are not absolutely necessary remove the dead skin from the popped blister apply ointment and change the bandage daily if the other blister is intact leave it alone until it pops then repeat the same steps for bandaging High-heeled shoe Psoriasis Shoe Eczema Pointe shoes Foot Sunburn Wound Sock First aid Callus Aerial (dance move) Fecal incontinence Skateboarding trick Footwear Acne Professional wrestling slang Dracunculiasis Aloe Bleeding Tap dance Professional wrestling match types 1957 World Series Sin City Cellulitis Kimono Domestic rabbit Alcoholics Anonymous Shoe fetishism 613 mitzvot Marching band Flip-flop Hiking Skin Laws of cricket Dobermann Johnny Cash Diving Ed, Edd n Eddy Leprosy Clothing Platform shoe Disc brake Scar Professional wrestling holds Theory of conduct Customs and etiquette of Japan Lanolin Wart Shoemaking Ulcer Kurt Angle Fast bowling Equine conformation Violin Hand grenade Manual transmission Dr. Martens Shaggy dog story Pump It Up Mouse (computing) Electrophysiology Herpes simplex virus Vampire Motorcycle Los Angeles Kings USS Suwannee (CVE-27) Empire Burlesque Undergarment Spice Girls The Death Gate Cycle Group A streptococcal infection Goldfinger Inflation Glossary of climbing terms Columbine High School massacre Glossary of partner dance terms Irish dance Dialysis Ski Castle Wars Foot binding Tennessee Walker Lyme disease The Marvelettes The Caves of Androzani Leggings Dog training Treehouse of Horror XV Antibiotic American Pie (song) Beetle Snowboard Textile manufacturing Spontaneous human combustion Transactional analysis Paul Is Dead Compiler optimization Jon Secada
