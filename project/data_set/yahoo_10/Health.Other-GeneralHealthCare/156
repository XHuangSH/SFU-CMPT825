lungs hurt in the morning mildly stuffy nose tired all day what's wrong with me i have been noticing that i am tired every day no matter how long i sleep i'll sleep for hours but i'll still feel fatigued during the day in the morning my nose will be a little stuffy and my lungs will hurt the lungs hurting goes away after i've been up for a few hours and the nose gets better and or unnoticeable as well i don't smoke regularly i'll smoke once every couple weeks or so at the pub what's going on with me it's been going on for a while i just didn't really notice it because it was so gradually and the symptoms aren't hugely life interference is this allergies sleep apnea lung cancer what's going on the pain is mild and only in the morning more of an ache really sometimes a bit of a cough accompanies it and it is with a stuffy nose and scratchy eyes obviously i need to have a doctor check but that answer isn't very helpful again i'm american we don't get to just go to the doctor unless we want to be going to the bank for a very long time i'm wondering if anyone has an educated diagnosis based on my symptoms alone obviously a trip to the doctor would be important but if that was something i could easily do i would have see a doctor in the mean time clean your bed very well put the pillows in the dryer on hot for a half hour vacuum the bed and turn the matress over strip the bed a couple of times a week and do the pillow in the dryer every days or so if you have dust mite allergies this will help with that i don't think you have life threatening symptoms but i do think they are serious and warrant a quick trip to the doc now go Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sleep apnea Chronic fatigue syndrome Asthma Stomach cancer Mattress Insomnia Hay fever First aid Prostate cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Nasal congestion Allergy Lung cancer Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Traumatic brain injury Cancer of the larynx Pneumonia Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Charles Darwin's illness Breastfeeding Social rule Cancer Tobacco smoking Opioid Hypertension The Shining (film) House dust mite Equine conformation Fancy rat Air pollution Milton H.
