does anyone know about vericose veins i have a vein that runs up my inner thigh and is very puffy it has been like this for a few years i am going to the doctor in a couple of weeks i just wanted to know if anyone has had anything similiar or what will the doctor do for this is there anything that will make this vein go back down to normal extended standing puts pressure on the varicosity and causes the swelling the valves in that vein are not working correctly and the blood can enter but doesn't leave properly your doctor will probably recommend support stockings which will compress the vein and she might suggest injections called scherotherapy that makes the vein shrivel up and at this point a secondary healthy vein takes over the transport of blood through this area there are also laser treatments she will recommend the best course years ago these veins were pulled out or stripped but now they prefer to save them in case you need them for angioplasty etc good luck and most medical plans pay for the stockings to a certain percentage Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Aortic dissection Myocardial infarction Varicocele Intracranial pressure Vein Prostate cancer Dialysis Cellulitis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Coronary catheterization Heart Hypertension Intravenous therapy Mitral regurgitation Stomach cancer Atrial septal defect Great saphenous vein Fetus Deep vein thrombosis Insulin Acne Carpal tunnel syndrome Blood vessel Carburetor Bleeding Psoriasis Kidney Drowning Angioplasty Siphon Equine conformation Emergency Medical Services Suicide methods Chronic fatigue syndrome Atkins Nutritional Approach Obstetrics Professional wrestling holds Penis Gastroparesis Pneumothorax Stocking Hypoglycemia Coronary circulation Cardiovascular disease Cardiology Lethal injection Turner syndrome Liver Breech birth Team Fortress Classic Dermatology Traumatic brain injury Warren Buffett Obesity Strap-on dildo Atherosclerosis Lymphatic system Inferior vena cava Vitamin C Annuity Eczema Yarrow Diving suit Air embolism Aortic insufficiency Endocarditis Intravascular ultrasound Blood pressure Shock Renal cell carcinoma Cancer Adjustable gastric band Carbon dioxide Infusion pump Ocean's Twelve Pneumonia Mitral stenosis Blood on the Tracks Tourniquet Chlorpromazine Thrombophlebitis Massage Lung Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Breastfeeding Migraine Radiation therapy Scar Atheroma Heart valve Puberty Medicine Blood transfusion
