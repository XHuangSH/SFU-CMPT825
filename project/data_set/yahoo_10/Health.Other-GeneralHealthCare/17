my month old has yet another ear infection are they contagious how does the infection causing bacteria enter the inner ear how are the infections and repeated ear infections prevented besides tubes besides the antibiotic and tylenol or motrin how do you help heal the infection and ease their discomfort he is in day care so he is exposed to germs but i did breastfeed him for months how do we prevent another ear infection after this one is healed no they are not contagious your child's ears do not have the capability to drain on their own so the result is a multitude of ear infections the bacteria enters through fluids entering the ear and subsequently cause infection prevention would be ear plugs at bath time and swimming my gran daughter had countless earaches until we had tubes put in if you do not control the problem your child will continue to suffer the earaches as well as high temps is there a valid reason why you do not wish to put the tubes in they are very helpful to a child who's ears cannot drain properly actually they are a necessity i am also in the medical field and i research alot so i hope this is helpful to you otherwise all you can do is treat the symptoms and let your child suffer the pain and high temps i could not bear it with my gran daughter she ran a high temp almost every other week as her ears would once again become infected this went on for a year before i put my foot down and demanded her parents do something about it she has been earache free since but you must keep the ears dry ear plugs until the tubes fall out on their own Pneumonia Psoriasis Breastfeeding Otitis externa Traumatic brain injury Common cold Tuberculosis Mastoiditis Medicine Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diving Otitis media AIDS Spina bifida Chronic fatigue syndrome Traditional Chinese medicine Swimming Dialysis Syphilis Body piercing Acne Prostate cancer Group A streptococcal infection Domestic rabbit Crohn's disease Certified Nursing Assistant Guinea pig Diabetes mellitus Asthma Antibiotic Virus Gonorrhoea Herpes simplex virus Hearing impairment Ulcerative colitis Medical analysis of circumcision Anthrax Hip fracture Sexually-transmitted infection Menstrual cycle Lyme disease Earring Intravenous therapy Diarrhea Conjunctivitis Stomach cancer Stroke Smallpox Dysentery Ebola Eustachian tube Balance disorder Biological warfare Cancer Escherichia coli O157:H7 Fecal incontinence Eczema Marburg virus Meningitis Botulism Growth hormone treatment HIV test Carburetor Fancy rat Premature birth Cystic fibrosis Multiple sclerosis Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Folic acid Wound Candidiasis Insulin Abortion Gangrene Influenza Reiter's syndrome Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome HIV Penicillin Milk Malaria Legionellosis Mumps Bubonic plague Gout Clostridium difficile Tattoo Cystoscopy Migraine Cirrhosis Infantilism AIDS reappraisal Antiviral drug Urinary tract infection Pelvic inflammatory disease Hepatitis C
