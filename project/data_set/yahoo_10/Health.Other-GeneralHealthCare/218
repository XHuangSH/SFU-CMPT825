just cant wake up i have a reasonably good diet but i am tired all most the time some times i get up to see my boyfriend off to work around and then go back and sleep till having breaky or a shower doesnt seem to help i just need good advice on how to get up and going and feeling good at the same time about it i know how you feel i've had that problem too it's not much fun it sounds painfully obvious but getting an early night is the first thing you should try and making sure that it's a night of nice deep sleep rather than horrible restless sleep before you go to bed early have a relaxing bath to calm you down also drinking caffeine free hot milky drinks will help you sleep better and do something relaxing in the hour or so before you go to bed like listening to relaxing music or reading a book when you wake up in the morning try a little light exercise to help wake you up properly nothing too taxing just twenty starjumps or a jog around your garden then shower and get dressed so you don't give yourself an excuse to go back to sleep make sure you keep eating as well because obviously food energy good foods to eat for energy are bread and pasta and other carbohydrate foods try to get into a bed time and getting up time routine so that your body can get used to it hope that helped good luck x Insomnia Social rule Sleep Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Avenue Q Sento Atkins Nutritional Approach Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Customs and etiquette of Japan Breakfast Caffeine Hypoglycemia Out-of-body experience Pasta Sauna Dieting Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mattress Cuisine of Denmark Singlish Word of Wisdom Chronic fatigue syndrome The Shining (film) Obesity Rule of St Benedict Low-carbohydrate diet W.I.T.C.H.
