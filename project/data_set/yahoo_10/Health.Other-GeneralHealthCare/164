is this blood pressure reading of borderline is this high could it push even higher and the patient be ok what are the symtoms to expect at this level reading the figures of are meaningless unless you can tell us the age of the patient and his pulse rate when taken the apparent b p's measured by your doctor are not actual pressures that is those generated by the left ventricle of the heart so placing too much store on their values is misleading however changes in them over the course of minutes hours days and even months pretty accurately reflect changes in cardiac generated pressures and this is why they're so useful in diagnoses they simply reflect these changes if your doctor can be bothered to interpret them correctly sadly most doctors can't and won't they can certainly go higher mine often do well over systolic but then i'm and work out hard regularly your age is average for western adults resting Blood pressure Hypertension Myocardial infarction Aortic valve stenosis Heart sounds Heart Pulse Atrial septal defect Physical examination Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Mitral regurgitation Ventricular fibrillation Cardiac arrest Aortic insufficiency Electrocardiogram Circulatory system Traumatic brain injury Cardiac cycle Aortic dissection Intracranial pressure Mitral valve prolapse Cardiac stress test Mitral stenosis Angina Sleep apnea Heart valve Artery Cardiac output Coronary circulation Cardiac arrhythmia Emergency Medical Services Prostate cancer Diabetes mellitus Coeliac disease Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Tide Turner syndrome Electrophysiology Medicine Asperger syndrome Urinary incontinence Coronary heart disease Action potential Stroke Sea level rise Acute respiratory distress syndrome Tachycardia Asthma Atrial fibrillation Congestive heart failure Paget's disease of bone Cardiopulmonary resuscitation Heart rate Shock Fuel injection Constrictive pericarditis Chiropractic Propranolol Ventricular septal defect Cardiovascular disease Hypercholesterolemia Chlorpromazine Doppler effect COX-2 inhibitor Aortic valve ELO rating system Stem cell Drowning Tocopherol Terri Schiavo Medical prescription Caffeine Apoplexy Medical ultrasonography Infusion pump Inflation Dialysis HIV test Flecainide Milton H.
