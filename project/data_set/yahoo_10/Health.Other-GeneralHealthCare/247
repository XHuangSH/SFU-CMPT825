why must you drink plenty of water while taking colace i'm taking colace mg a day and i was given direction from the doctor to take two vegetable laxatives in the morning and two at night i'm not constipated but i have rectal bleeding due to tons of internal hemorrhoids so my stool needs to be soft to help prevent any extra damage but why is it so important there is a sticker on the rx bottle that says drink plenty of water while taking this medication i'm not a pharmacist just a decent guesser since colace adds water to the stool to keep it soft your body may require extra water when you take it it's going to be tying up some of the water in you that you'd ordinarily be using for proper hydration for digestion so you need more another possibility is that the tablets or capsules whatever they are need plenty of water to fully dissolve Hemorrhoid Fecal incontinence Constipation Laxative Dietary fiber Diarrhea Urinary incontinence Crohn's disease Enema Mattress Breastfeeding Medical prescription Beer Stomach cancer Diverticulosis Schistosomiasis Coeliac disease Prostate cancer Cirrhosis Colorectal cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Antiretroviral drug Dehydration Hyperthermia Folic acid Colonoscopy Human feces Stroke Pharmacist Irritable bowel syndrome Sigmoidoscopy Tocopherol Water Hydrochloric acid Hirschsprung's disease Sulfasalazine Cephalexin Soft drink Alcoholic beverage Hypoglycemia Alcohol Drink Dieting Adjustable gastric band Rice Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fasting Botulism Entamoeba histolytica Gout Bong Intravenous therapy Magnesium International response to Hurricane Katrina Route of administration Rectum Tooth Anal fissure Chair Feces Cancer Fluoxetine Pepsi-Cola First aid Insomnia Hamster Capercaillie Cystic fibrosis Menstrual cycle Healthy eating Opioid Methamphetamine Decompression sickness Escherichia coli O157:H7 Warfarin Gonorrhoea Bladderwort Diazepam Flatulence Medicine Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Emergency contraception Cuisine of Denmark Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Tofu Japanese toilet Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Sulfuric acid Cricket Textile manufacturing Strap-on dildo Concrete Paget's disease of bone Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Polyethylene terephthalate Ebola Jute Aspirin
