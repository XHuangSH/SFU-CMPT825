work late shift sleeping habits i've been working odd hours at my new job some days i will work the day shift sometimes and most recently i've been working days at time from midnight till am when i work the am shift i never know when to sleep i can't fall asleep till like in the morning but i still wake up about pm then i'm tired as hell before i go into work so i take a nap at about pm till pm but wake up just feeling soooo groggy before work does anyone else would crazy hours like this and how do you deal since i'm part time my shifts are never predictable except for the weekends where i have a set shift over the summer break from school i've worked literally every shift they have in this department and i work in a hospital so they have lots of shifts available i find when i work a late night shift and i can't fall asleep i just watch some tv or an episode of a tv show so i can wind down and get into the lazy mode that puts me to sleep try taking a cool shower too that usually puts me out if you're desperate there's like this sleepy time tea or something to that extent that makes you sleepy Narcolepsy Sleep Daylight saving time Characters in the Smurfs Delayed sleep phase syndrome The Amber Spyglass Insomnia Avenue Q Social rule Futurama (TV series - season 5) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Henri Murger Oh My Goddess!
