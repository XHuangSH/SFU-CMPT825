for doctors is being a doctor anything like scrubs i dont think it is but if it is it'll be a plus out of all the medical shows including e r house and grey's anatomy i think that scrubs is actually the most like being a doctor especially a resident scrubs is focused on residency training well now i guess they're mostly new attendings and a lot of what happens is pretty close those other shows are way more far fetched with respect to the scope of what doctors do and practice on house the docs run labs the woman always with the micropipetter in hand run the mris go to patient's houses to look for clues we never do this grey's anatomy the surgeons roll into work with the sun up looking around a m no way and they have at lot more free time on that show to set up all the scandals and love triangles in real life they would be working scrubs docs always seem to be at a hospital or icu which isn't the case during residency lots of time is spent in outpatient clinics as well as far as the interaction with nurses and patients there are a lot of similarities keep in mind it's still a tv show i don't really know what you mean though by it being a plus it's hard work and that's not always conveyed through the show Medicine Nurse Physician Scrubs (TV show) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scrubs Strong Medicine General practitioner Hospital Medicare (Canada) Psychiatry Mental Health Act 1983 Publicly funded medicine Midwifery Psychiatric hospital Nursing Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Physical therapy Medical University of South Carolina Milton H.
