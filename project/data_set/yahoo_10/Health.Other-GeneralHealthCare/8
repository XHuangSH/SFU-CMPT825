can a health care provider force a patient into a nursing home my father is elderly and this year has been suffering through multiple small strokes each one takes more and more of his motor skills away simply standing up is a lot of work and requires assistance now mom is there hours a day and us adult children are splitting shifts there to help out we are certain he doesn't have a lot of time left and none of us want him to go into a home although difficult and sometimes stressful we feel we can handle the responsibility now last night dad suffered another stroke this time it appears he was getting out of his recliner late at night and when the stroke happened he fell this instantly alerted us and we were able to assist but the doctors seem concerned that his falling may be a sign that we need him in an care facility in the end whose decision is it can the doctor force him into a care facility or does the family have the ultimate power to make that decision thank you all for your answers i wish i could award you all pts mom is deathly afraid that the doctor is going to make him leave his home i will pass on to her your answers this is a very hard position to be in i was in something similar not so long ago however there were other older people to make the final decision there are some cases where a medical professional can deem that someone is not safe in their own home however depending upon the legal precedents that your father set up he may be able to get the last say the hardest part about this whole thing is that the world forces you to learn policy procedure of living wills probate power of attorney etc etc rather than spending that time with your father mother and family i think what you your family are doing is exceptional and while it is just what you all would do there are so many people that would not i wish you and your family all of the strength in the world i do do what you feel is best and if it is for him to remain in his home then fight it i know it's a hassle and it makes reasonable people just shake their heads but while the medical world acts as if they are trying to keep your father 'safe' in actuality they are just making a ruling on a patient this is your father not a patient the man you've grown up with the man you love the man you've looked up to and for all of this he deserves to live his remaining time with those that love him most now if it is deemed that irrespective of all the people around that none of you are medically knowledgeable to care for him well then they may be able to force your hands no matter what let your mother know what a superior person she is it is never easy to say good bye however it is even harder to have someone force their decisions on your family i wish there was an easy answer but i think what you your family are doing is great and i extend the most sincere well wishes of strength love i wish you well i wish you peace Nurse Medicine Divorce Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion in the United States Fathers' rights Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion debate Transactional analysis Certified Nursing Assistant Euthanasia Urinary incontinence Mental Health Act 1983 Consensus decision-making Prostate cancer Social rule Medicare (Canada) Appeal Theory of conduct Traumatic brain injury Transsexuality Medical prescription Scientology beliefs and practices Health insurance Ethics Abortion Contract Publicly funded medicine Stomach cancer Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nursing Stroke Nursing home Involuntary commitment Medical record Free will Mother Teresa Hearing impairment Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Royal Assent British nationality law Theodicy Pitaten Roe v.
