is this a lot i go out at the weekend at least one or two night if not im worried im over drinking example i stayed in sat night and drank full bottle of jp charnet wine to myself and had a chinese before it i went clubbing sunday night and had cans of corrs light before we got to the club i had two more bottles of corrs light and glasses of wine you know the wine you get in a pub or club the small bottles quater of a bottle i find i get so many black outs have arguments with my friend sometimes which the next morning seems so silly over and always the next day im so tired and moody and take it out on my mam i then feel guilty about it but cos im so tired i just want to sleep and be on my own i feel almost depressed the morning after i tryed to give up drink before but found it really boaring when im out and self consious im years old and only drink at the weekend i eat health all week and work out but at the weekend i cant stick to being healthy with years nursing experience i can tell you this is the beginning of a deadly vicious cycle we like to call alcoholism the fact that you are blacking out should be the hugest red flag for you alcoholism starts out small just like with you a drink or two here and there then you're drinking yourself drunk one night a week then it slowly progresses from there you were able to get yourself drunk on an entire bottle of wine at home you didn't even go anywhere this will become an easy habit for you if you continue the fact that you drink every single weekend and to the extent that you describe it won't be long before you will need a drink during the week as well just to curb your body's craving for it then before you know it you're getting drunk the minute you get home from work every night because your body can no longer take going hours w out alcohol being healthy all week won't make up for the amount of alcohol you've put your body through during the entire weekend your liver is on overdrive that whole time and barely has time to recoup before you attack it again all alcohol has to be filtered through your liver which causes it to die over time of excessive alcohol abuse it's called cirrosis or fatty liver this is when your healthy liver's tissue turns into fatty blubber and is basically useless and just so you know alcoholics aren't allowed a liver transplant then there's your kidneys to worry about alcohol is a diuretic which means it sucks the water out of your body that you need to maintain a healthy fluid level right blood levels electrolyte balance etc which causes you to produce more urine over working your kidneys i'm not telling you any of this to scare you it's the truth a drink once in a great while or maybe one party nite a month is ok but drinking to the point of blacking out downing an entire bottle of wine on your own in one night and drinking every weekend is putting you on the fast track to developing a habit you won't be able to kick w out great effort and more than likely not before you've done permanent damage to your health you have time to stop it b c you're young but you have to do it now Breastfeeding Alcoholism Hypoglycemia Kidney Dialysis Cirrhosis Insulin EastEnders Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fasting Diabetes mellitus Cocaine Prostate cancer Caffeine Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Blood Wine Stomach cancer Alcoholics Anonymous Folic acid Glycogen storage disease type I Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Beer Nutrition Gout Shaggy dog story Tobacco smoking Social rule Liver Fancy rat Sake Oasis (band) Bong Sleep Stroke Vitamin C Diazepam Knots Landing Cancer Marathon (sport) First aid Soft drink National Football League Theory of conduct Ben Johnson (athlete) Rum Water Tea Hepatitis C Electrophysiology Michael Garibaldi Coeliac disease Traumatic brain injury Chronic fatigue syndrome Guinea pig Fugu Champagne (beverage) Clinical depression Diabetes insipidus Milk Diabetic ketoacidosis Decompression sickness Trainspotting (novel) Drug test Drag racing Humphrey Bogart Paracetamol Glucocorticoid Chlorpromazine Alcohol Organ transplant Bipolar disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Puberty Mickey Mantle Veganism Word of Wisdom Weight training Electrolyte International League Protein-energy malnutrition Moonshine Australian words Indianapolis 500 Psoriasis Vitamin Hamster One Tree Hill (TV series) Hyperthermia Pneumonia Obesity
