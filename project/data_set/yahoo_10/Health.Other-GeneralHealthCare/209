i broke my arm and i'm worried i'm and about years ago i was riding my scooter and i fell i went to the hospital the next day and they said that i had a buckle break they put a splint on it and gave me a sling than they told me to ice it and go to an orthopedic doctor i did that but i think that they misdiagnosed my arm because they said that a buckle break takes about weeks to heal and i had a long arm cast on for around weeks and a short arm cast for around weeks do you think that they could have misdiagnosed my arm also i think that because it was misdiagnosed it could have been treated wrong because it took a long time to heal and my wrist seems to sprain alot more easily and it sometimes hurts what do you think they diagnosed you right they put the cast on you and put them on for longer periods of time to make sure the bone healed back into the right place it is normal after a fracture that the area will be weakened after that that is why you hurt that arm more easily now i broke both of my feet years ago and i can't wear high heel shoes any longer Equine conformation Carpal tunnel syndrome Orthopedic surgery Shoe Bone fracture Hip fracture Stress fracture Professional wrestling holds Diving Bruise First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Paget's disease of bone Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Sling (weapon) Aerial (dance move) Sin City Final Fantasy magic EastEnders High-heeled shoe Kodocha Michael Garibaldi Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Osteoporosis Strike (attack) Casting Ceramics Kurt Angle Chiropractic Social rule Professional wrestling attacks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Archery Coeliac disease Foot Fencing Swingout Flat feet The Curse of Fenric Volleyball Glossary of climbing terms Gears and Vehicles (Xenogears) Tenshinhan Jessica Lynch Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Podiatrist Harp Waking the Dragons Piccolo Junior Saga Stomach cancer Crucifixion Wound Mattress YuYu Hakusho Church of Christ, Scientist 1957 World Series Chair Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Medicine Warrior (World of Warcraft) Punch (strike) Childbirth Neighbours Migraine Osteogenesis imperfecta Single bullet theory Orthodontics Comfrey Pregnancy The Empty Child Majin Buu Saga Growth hormone treatment Skateboarding trick End of Han Dynasty Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling match types Parade (military) Traditional Chinese medicine Professional wrestling throws Bob Rae Shin splints Replacement joint Snowboard Urinary incontinence Pain Jackass: The Movie Knife Weapon Diving suit Eddie Guerrero Bryan Robson Wild ARMs 2 Horizontal bar Straitjacket The Family from One End Street Mario Weight training Diablo II Sydney Riot of 1879
