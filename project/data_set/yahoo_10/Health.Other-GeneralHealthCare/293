why does my boyfriend twitch as he's falling asleep his limbs twitch but only as he's falling asleep and he doesn't know he's doing it as he's already half asleep it's normal and a lot of people do it it's because he is entering the first realm of sleep if you watch him i bet his eyes are even fluttering this is the realm of sleep where the muscles start to relax and where you would dream basically your body is asleep but your brain is still awake which is why if you were to talk to him he would still hear you some people get really bad with spasms me personally i find that my entire leg will jump and it normally startles me into waking up good luck but it is normal and nothing you can do to fix it Out-of-body experience Sleep Narcolepsy Lucid dreaming Urinary incontinence Insomnia Dream Muscle Social rule Sleep paralysis Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Phoebe Halliwell Epilepsy The Amber Spyglass Scenes from a Memory Myoclonus Philosophical skepticism Caffeine Proprioception The Shining (film) Restless legs syndrome Characters of The Sandman Sleep disorder Shaggy dog story Orgasm Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sleep debt Bedwetting Phantasms (TNG episode) Equine conformation Datalore (TNG episode) Physical strength Cat Electroencephalography The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Hansel und Gretel The Death Gate Cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hypnosis Dreamlands Sin City Rapid eye movement Backstroke Aikido Conker's Bad Fur Day Avenue Q Suicide methods 50 First Dates Poliomyelitis The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Cephalic disorder Diazepam Brigadoon Jam (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Sleep apnea Whale Oh My Goddess!
