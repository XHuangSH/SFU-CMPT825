this may be the weirdest thing you ever hear ever since i was like years old and i am now i have picked my belly button yes you heard it correctly so we'll say about years or so i pick it like everywhere i go at night at school during the day discreetly when i am not at home and sometimes when the urge is so bad i do it through my shirt so i was just wondering what i can do to stop i am getting to the point that i am worried i am going to get some sort of like stomach infection or like something it's all like scabby and gross and like weird it's an innie so you can't really tell but if you have any ideas or concerns or anything please help me it can get really annoying and like embarrasing thanks so much ok so here's the problem you have a behavior that you have done for so long you can't stop it is a habit and you do it without even thinking about it so the question is do you really want to stop is it affecting your life in an adverse way sounds like it isn't a huge deal i never heard of anyone getting a belly button infection from picking too much if it is bugging you that much then it might be time to alter that behavior you shouldn't need to see a doctor unless you think there might be an infection people have little habits all the time i bite my nails constantly so there is a similarity there you are picking for some reason to keep your fingers busy to feel your belly button anxiety there can be a ton of different reasons the idea is to find out why and attack that side of the problem whatever you do don't try to substitute something else to pick besides your belly button like a bracelet this isn't stopping the behavior but transferring it eventually you will have to stop picking at the bracelet and won't be able to stop here are some things you can try wrap a string around the finger that you use to pick at it this may remind you to stop try to keep your hands busy doing other things chart when you do it is there a pattern are you more likely to do it at certain times of the day reward yourself with something say if i can go the whole day without picking i'll get a mocha or something else that you really want have other people remind you talk to your family though it might be embarrassing tell them to swat your hand every time you pick this will become annoying but it is effective hope this helps some Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Milton H.
