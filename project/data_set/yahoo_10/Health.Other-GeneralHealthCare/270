what is the best way to lower blood pressure and cholesterol my dad would like to know please he has tried several prescribed meds but they make him feel ill any ideas hi djjd you say your dad feels ill from the prescription meds he gets from his doctor did his doctor just put him on pills immediately upon finding out he had high blood bp and cholesterol i ask because the first thing the highest majority of knowlegable gp's will try their oout on a low fat low cholesterol strict diet and if your dad is a smoker he should have been told to quit like yesterday also your dad should've been given a recommended excercise routine that the dr approves of well there are so many things that can be tried before trust me once doc's get a bp cholesterol patient on pills they are for life like luggage and the side effects can really make one feel very poorly like your dad did there is a fruit juice that is sold in most large grocery stores tesco asda etc that is awesome for these two maladies it is pomenegrate juice my fiancee' has high bp and high cholesterol and we have managed to keep him from not having to take pills and we have come very close to almost having to a few times btw the pomegrenate juice usually comes with one other added healthy juice like acai berries taste like blueberries and raspberry or it can be bought straight with just the pomegrenate juice he also takes ginko biloba times a week and drinks the actimel bacterial drinks they come usually in packs and are very very small bottles like the same amount of a medium sized shot glass also it sounds gross and i'm glad i don't have to drink it it's soya milk and he alternates each week from soya milk to rice milk actimel and he swears it tastes good we take a mt walk every night after dinner and on weekends we take our son out i e to the park for soccer practice we help out the rspca and are volunteer dog walkers etc my biggest suggestion is to try as many avenues as you can to keep your dad from having to stay on pills because he'll be on them for life good luck to you and your dad god bless Milk Veganism Dieting Nutrition Vitasoy Chocolate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cholesterol Wal-Mart Soy milk Breastfeeding Tesco Atkins Nutritional Approach Hypercholesterolemia Oral contraceptive Diabetes mellitus Antiretroviral drug Coronary heart disease Tobacco smoking Chronic fatigue syndrome Alcoholic beverage Urinary incontinence Migraine Dairy Antidepressant Dietary fiber Rum Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bong Cuisine of Denmark Folic acid Atherosclerosis Cheese Omega-3 fatty acid Wine Vegetarianism Medical prescription Food Stomach cancer Medical cannabis Vitamin C Coeliac disease Colorectal cancer Cider Alzheimer's disease Sildenafil Vitamin D Low density lipoprotein Cannabis (drug) Low-carbohydrate diet Tofu Organic food Tea Caffeine Insulin Obesity Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fanta Diarrhea Breakfast Trans fat Kosher foods Bipolar disorder Medicine Clinical depression Soybean Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Gout Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Homeopathy The Coca-Cola Company Hamster Trailer Park Boys Guinea pig Social rule Friends Fecal incontinence Pharmaceutical company One Piece minor characters Ginkgo Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Yoghurt Jewish cuisine Humphrey Bogart Acne Egg (food)
