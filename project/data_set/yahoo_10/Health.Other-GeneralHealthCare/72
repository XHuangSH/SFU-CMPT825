er billing errors pulmonary diag iv therapy etc please help hello i just got my bill from an er visit a couple weeks back and i believe it has some errors as i remember all the tests i had done but maybe i just don't understand the way they coded this i plan on calling them moday morning but was hoping somebody here might be able to help there is a charge for pulmonary diag but they didn't check my lungs at all unless they are counting when the dr used her stethoscope and listened to me inhale and exhale there is a charge for pharmacy but i wasn't given any medication not even a prescription there is a charge for iv therapy would a foley catheter used for an ultrasound count as this that is the only way that would make sense all my other charges make sense to me except there is a charge for emergency room why would it be for does anybody know and it says you will receive a serparate bill for physician services what would this include thanks thanks i had nothing done with my lungs no xrays the ultrasound was of my uterus they took blood from me but why would i have in front of the er billing that would be like i was there twice no oh and i had no inhaler since i wasn't there for my lungs but for abnormal uterine bleeding but thanks so much for answering i appreciate the help ahhh i didn't even have a tylenol no meds whatsoever i think it's a mistake rosie c thanks for the edit but my bill does have tons of other charges on it for things i do recognise i think they added somebody elses stuff on it too thanks for the help zelo i wasn't offered anything h o with the catheter it says emergency room and other items are listed the same way with the before it like for laboratory for the tests hospitals are notorious for charging exorbitant charges you should call the business office of the hospital in the morning and question the charges thanks for the addtl details the clinical picture is clear now since your main complaint is unusual uterine bleeding iyour case is of a gynecological nature i strongly suspect they gave you erroneous charges that belong to some other pt who had a pulmonary problem and received iv therapy and med and the like there's no mention of the ultrasound done on you and the lab test for blood work expect a big bill for the diagnostic procedure of the non invasive ultrasound on a non emergency basis it's exorbitant the procdure cost about plus the evaluation is another and when done under an emergency basis it becomes more expensive the amt of alone speaks of the nature of the urgency use of the er the stands for the room in the er hopefully you do have health insurance as incessant vaginal bleeding is an emergency situation it should be totally covered if you met your deductible for the year good luck on the success of your fight against the charges demand a better explanation notify your insurance to question also Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Asthma Childbirth Pneumonia Traumatic brain injury Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Endometrial cancer Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary hypertension Gynaecology Health insurance Medical prescription Publicly funded medicine Intravenous therapy Atrial septal defect Stroke Lung cancer Ovarian cancer Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cervical cancer Medical record Endometriosis Miscarriage Infertility Abortion Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Adverse effect (medicine) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Medicare (Canada) Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Wal-Mart Breech birth Malignant melanoma Triage In vitro fertilisation Homeopathy Malaria Autism Polycystic ovary syndrome Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Hypoglycemia Pregnancy Uterine fibroids Sleep apnea Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Migraine Bronchitis Gynecologic hemorrhage Emergency department Amiodarone Tuberculosis Tobacco smoking Mesothelioma Pharmaceutical company Emergency Medical Services Traditional Chinese medicine AIDS Coronary catheterization Emergency medical technician HIV test Expert system Ectopic pregnancy Acute respiratory distress syndrome Insurance Drug test Pneumothorax Medical analysis of circumcision Pulmonology Obesity Aphasia AIDS reappraisal Roswell UFO incident Extreme Programming Canada Health Act Cardiac arrhythmia Non-invasive (medical) Pulmonary artery catheter Radiation therapy Growth hormone treatment Chiropractic Plame affair Debugging Terri Schiavo Computed tomography Physical therapy Aortic dissection Radiology
