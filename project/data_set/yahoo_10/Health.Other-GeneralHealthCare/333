acute ear pain but not an infection please help last saturday me and my family visited busch gardens during our vacation to florida i rode ever roller coaster in the park after going on the kumba for the second time in minutes which is a high force roller coaster one that sends you through big loops corkscrews etc at high speeds i noticed my ear felt wired like there was pressure in it it only felt that way after i rode the roller coaster for the second time i didnt pay much attention until i got off another roller coaster almost identical to that one i felt pain in my eat but ignored it the pain lessened everday day until today when it feels really painful i don't think its an infection because of what happened after the coaster i don't want to see a doctor and my parents won't take me andway what should i do and what could be the problem it been hurting really bad in the last minutes its throbbing and i feel alot of pressure in that whole area i still don't think my parents will take me to a doctor and i couldn't pay to go myself i think you do need to go to a doctor you could have a tear in your eardrum which could actually cost you your hearing there is obviously some type of trauma to your inner ear you need to get it looked at by a doctor Roller coaster Knoebels Cedar Point Wooden roller coaster Busch Gardens RollerCoaster Tycoon Valleyfair!
