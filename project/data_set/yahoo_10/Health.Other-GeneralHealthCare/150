i just quit smoking and i am having some strange responses i just quit smoking about days ago saturday night and i am having the normal cravings and figidiness but as of last night i had the most rotten sleep of my life and i was exhausted when i went to bed i woke up numerous times talking to myself and looking at the clock also i want to eat cheese a lot lots and lots of melted cheese this may be the strangest part of all my breasts are extremely sensitive sore now i read online that when you quit the nerve endings in your body begin to grow again and you may get strange sensations and food tastes better but it is almost like being pregnant i am at my rd day right now can someone tell me when it will get better i heard your rd day is the worst so hopefully it is all downhill from here i quit smoking weeks ago and sweetheart it's not an easy thing to do i have been a full fledged smoker for almost years meaning at least packs a day after watching my dad pass away from lung cancer in february among many other heartbreaking diseases i vowed to my mother that i would try my hardest to quit and i did the food cravings are normal your body is going through a hard time adjusting and may think it needs things it doesn't that is why a lot of people tend to gain weight when they quit smoking they begin to crave other things or they use food as a replacement for the hand to mouth habit your body is stressed and the first week or two are not gonna be too easy the best advice i can give you is to make sure you tell yourself that you are proud of yourself and that you really do want to quit try not to think about smoking or be around it much for the first two weeks the smell will still be enticing to you right now wait a couple weeks and people will begin to smell like ash trays that's when it gets easier good luck and stay strong Tobacco smoking EastEnders Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Urinary incontinence Vampire Kurt Cobain Cigarette Stomach cancer Equine conformation Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cheese Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Daylight saving time Atkins Nutritional Approach Coeliac disease Shark Shaggy dog story Common cold Milton H.
