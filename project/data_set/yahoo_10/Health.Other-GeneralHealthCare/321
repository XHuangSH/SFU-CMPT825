do we sometimes suffer with illness that we can't explain last night i had a huge crushing pain around my rib cage during the course of the next two hours the pain spread to every joint and muscle in my body until i was literally unable to move freezing cold and shivering within an hour the sensation began to ease and i slept for several hours i woke up this morning a little stiff and sore in places but much better this evening i'm almost back to i cannot explain what i went through or why i went through it because i am not unwell at the moment but i do wonder if our bodies ocassionally go through these inexplicable episodes and are working a lot harder than we ever give them credit for no i don't believe it was a heart attack as my heart was beating quite normally and happily yes it did cross my mind in the early stages i think it was some sort of virus that my body simply fought incredible awww sweetie feel better soon you know im suffering archieitus it casues fevers and unexplained rumblings where there should be no rumblings feel better xxxxx Glen Jacobs First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Equine conformation Chronic fatigue syndrome Leon White Thermoregulation Group A streptococcal infection Insomnia The Amber Spyglass Futurama (TV series - season 5) Paul Levesque Professional wrestling match types Fibromyalgia Sin City Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story Oh My Goddess!
