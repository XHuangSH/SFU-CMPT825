how do you fix damaged cuticles hangnails i've been painting my fingernails alot lately and my cuticles on my thumbs are totally messed up now also i have this really bad hangnail and i would like know how i can get rid of it cuz it hurts and is really annoying thanks so much i don't know about other people but for me what seems to work the best is to soak your hands in lotion on the really bad cuticles before bed i slather lotion on them and a bandaid then put the lotion covered bandaid over it for hangnails i usually just either bandaid them or pull it off so it stops catching on everything and keep them covered till they heal to avoid the cuticle hangnail issues just carry a tiny bottle of lotion with you and use it every time after you wash your hands Manicure Nail (anatomy) Pedicure Social rule Eczema Scabies Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Arthropod The Shining (film) Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaving Vernon Schillinger Professional wrestling holds Milton H.
