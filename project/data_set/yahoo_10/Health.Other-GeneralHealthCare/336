what is it about getting a massage that relaxes us i used to train at the gym for up to hours really agressively i stopped for about years and just the other day i trained again my approach was just as agressive as if i never stopped but with less weights and i only lasted hour mins the day after i was so sore i could bareley get out of bed and i could barely pick up a glass of water i could not even lift a book up to read the day after that i went for a massage the massues stood on me and applied a lot of pressure all over my body after the massage i was completely relaxed and only my arms are slightly sore what exactly is it about a massage that relaxes us is it the pressure applied to our bodies once the pressure is applied it's really uncomfortable but once it's released there is releif or is it the kneading of the muscles that causes releif btw i did not get a happy ending from the massues but i did get some from my girl after i went to the gym and the day before i went to the massues and that didn't releive any of my back and neck soreness besides the relief of relaxing tight muscles massage causes the release of endorphins into the system if you don't know what endorphins are they are the body's natural pain killer actually similar to morphine in composition so obviously you are more wonderfully relaxed when that happens and i hate it when people automatically have to ask about happy endings with massage it really is an insult to professional therapists Massage Repetitive strain injury Professional wrestling holds Reflexology Equine conformation Weight training Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Physical therapy Endorphin Myocardial infarction Sento First aid Professional wrestling throws Milton H.
