is there a way to prevent warts i started getting a tiny wart here and there a few years back when i went through a stressful and depressing time in my marriage i never had a wart prior to this and i am in my late twenties i thought maybe it was because my immune system was down from everything going on they were so tiny it was hard to tell what they were until it was diagnosed i would just have a brownish spot smaller than the size of a pin rarely they would grow and i would have to have them frozen off by the derm well i have been laid off for several months and am under tremendous stress i am having an outbreak that is the worst i can recall it seems like they keep coming back bigger and stronger instead of having i have at least large ones i try filing them down using the liquid and i even bought dr scholls freeze off i would like to boost my immune system and prevent these from coming i am interviewing and am so self conscious they are now big enough where i can actually see the seeds ugh it is disgusting i feel less than human it isn't very attractive that's for sure i don't have insurance right now to go to a derm but believe me i will head there the day i get healthcare what can i do in the meantime i heard warts are a strain of hpv and that the vitamin lysene can prevent some strains of hpv would this work how can i fight this virus they are on my fingers i wash my hands multiple times a day but they aren't moist i used to think they only occurred in breaks of the skin but i am getting them on spots where it is unlikely to have a tear also how come if i get one on a certain spot on my finger another one in that same exact spot appears on the other hand it is so bizarre no there are some several hundred variations of the hpv virus it's more of a family than one specific virus it's just that they all cause warts some prefer certain body parts to others and the way the warts look can be different there really isn't any way to prevent them aside from the genital variety that will be blocked with a condom even then you can still get them in other spots in the area the over the counter preps work as well as anything the doctor uses even the freeze off is the same liquid nitrogen it will take a while to get them shifted off though anywhere up to a few months sometimes it works faster if you scrub the dead cells off before applying more but if you are patient it will still work and cheaper than the dermatologist as well you are quite human because the virus only attacks humans the varieties that attack animals don't affect us and vice versa some folks are just more susceptible to the viruses that's all other than attending to your overall health there isn't really anything you can take that will help much although stress can lower the immune system it wouldn't be a significant thing to explain warts you could certainly up your b complex vitamin intake as that's the one most depleated in stress but really just an ordinary multivitamin mineral supplement and a balanced diet will do well but otherwise just pick your favorite over the counter wart remover and plug away at them they will shift off with patience and daily treatment Herpes simplex virus Human papillomavirus Multiple sclerosis Wart Acne Cancer Prostate cancer Psoriasis Cervical cancer Nutrition Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tocopherol Cytomegalovirus Folic acid Milk Homeopathy Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Vitamin C AIDS reappraisal Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eczema Stomach cancer Virus AIDS Carpal tunnel syndrome Autism Medical analysis of circumcision Rabies Alzheimer's disease Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Osteoporosis Smallpox HIV Sexually-transmitted infection Cryonics Breastfeeding Anemia Immune system Influenza Urinary incontinence Antiviral drug Veganism Molluscum contagiosum Traumatic brain injury Coeliac disease Zinc Dog Bipolar disorder Ebola Pneumonia HIV test Milton H.
