can a lab test your blood for drugs without permission like can they say oh we just need to test for immunizations or whatever and then secretly test for drugs or do u have to sign a waiver any know i work in a lab and have found that each lab is different the short answer is no but if a parent of a minor or the doctor requests that a drug test be done that is legal usually urine is tested for drugs of abuse some drugs like prescription drugs or tylenol are done from blood but i wouldn't expect there to be any other reason to do it labs don't go around running tests they don't get paid to do taking a cue from tv shows i suppose if the blood has been drawn and a crime has been committed then the investigation will test the blood for confirmation of drug use this assumes the blood was drawn by a forensic team but they can requisition blood from private medical facilities ask your parents if it comes to that if you don't know they would i see no reason for your doctor to run tests on you without your knowledge but that would be the other source to the answer of your question Drug test Plame affair Prostate cancer Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Pharmaceutical company Paracetamol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma International Criminal Court Duesberg hypothesis 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Food and Drug Administration Schapelle Corby Forensics Methamphetamine Karl Rove Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Medical record Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus AIDS reappraisal Drunk driving (United States) Cancer Medical prescription Medical cannabis Controlled Substances Act Contract Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Urinalysis Ben Johnson (athlete) Plame affair timeline Cytomegalovirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Urinary incontinence Erythropoietin Illegal drug trade HIV test Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Tour de France Lupus erythematosus Psoriasis Rush Limbaugh Insulin Allergy Drug addiction Arguments for and against drug prohibition Psychiatric hospital Health insurance Medical laboratory Graduate school Prohibition (drugs) Folic acid Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Lance Armstrong Cocaine Expert system Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Prescription drug Drug abuse Stomach cancer Shroud of Turin Project MKULTRA Endometriosis Hepatitis C Blood transfusion Probation officer Human sexual behavior Psychology 2001 anthrax attacks Stem cell Philosophical skepticism Rape LSD Kurt Cobain Abortion in the United States Physician Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Anorexia nervosa Terri Schiavo Hypertension Abortion debate Asthma Unit 731 Marc Dutroux Antiretroviral drug Pharmacopoeia Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia Publicly funded medicine Surveillance Hepatitis Coeliac disease Medicare (Canada) Tobacco smoking Growth hormone treatment The Caves of Androzani Eczema Blood alcohol content Killian documents West Memphis 3
