do i have sleep apnea a couple of nights ago i actually had like to episodes of trying to fall asleep and like minutes later im gasping for air scaring myself to death i tried it again and again but the same thing happened to me i knew i couldnt fall asleep so i was doing some research online and found out that that was sleep apnea and now im afraid this has happened to me before but it seems like it happens when im under stress or my anxiety kicks in i dont know if this is something i should take seriously or not please help thank you you absolutely must go to a neurologist who specializes in sleep disorders it definitely sounds like sleep apnea but if it comes and goes there may be another way to deal with it than the breathing machine most people wear to bed Insomnia Sleep Urinary incontinence Apnea Out-of-body experience Narcolepsy Sleep debt Continuous positive airway pressure Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Drowning Diazepam EastEnders Sudden infant death syndrome Lucid dreaming Traumatic brain injury Shaggy dog story Hypertension Down syndrome Panic attack Anxiety Sleep deprivation Hypoglycemia The Girl Who Slept Too Little Carbon dioxide Post-traumatic stress disorder Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obesity Cluster headache The Subtle Knife Combat stress reaction Carpal tunnel syndrome Cardcaptor Sakura Psychiatry Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Myoclonus Characters in the Smurfs Bipolar disorder Respiratory rate Vampire Snoring Project MKULTRA 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Child sexuality Phaedo Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Baldness Pulmonology Controversies in autism Psychoanalysis Hypnosis Breath of Fire III George Costanza The Amber Spyglass Clinical depression Futurama (TV series - season 5) Duchenne muscular dystrophy Delayed sleep phase syndrome Sleep paralysis Bedwetting Sedative Cat Clonazepam Kurt Cobain The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Fan death Psychosis The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Eunuch Infantilism Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Siesta Chronic fatigue syndrome Oh My Goddess!
