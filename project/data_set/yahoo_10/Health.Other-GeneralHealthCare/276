health care i live in the us and i am looking for people who live in other countries and have a nhs or free medical care that could tell me about it and how it works honestly in canada health care isn't free we pay for it with our taxes overall we pay about the same as people in the us do for taxes our health care per person averages year in the us it's year the health insurance companies don't profit off the sick and old like they do in the us we are healthier and live longer with our less expensive government provided health care when i signed up for my doctor in canada i gave my health card number ever since then i haven't had to present it i can get an appointment within a week and i get a shot once a week in the clinic lab without a problem if i need to go to the er i can do that if i need a doctor appointment i can get one within a week there are walk in clinics around if i need service sooner but it isn't urgent i have unlimited health insurance that gets canceled only when i die with no limits because the federal government negotiates drug prices with the drug companies some drugs are significantly less expensive than they are in the us my doctor in canada is very successful whereas my doctor in pennsylvania is about to shut his office down because he can't afford to work there anymore with the reduction in medicare reimbursements he gets now your country's war in iraq is draining money from government funded health services and hurting the people it's supposed to be helping if someone told you that you would lose of your income today do you think you could continue as you are my doctor in pennsylvania is seriously considering coming to canada he can open his own office here and help a lot of people while making decent money hospital care is free of charge to the patients we all pay for it with our taxes doctor visits testing and home care is also provided without you having to pay for it yourself immunizations for everyone are paid for by the government we have it pretty good in canada if you're poor old a student etc where you wouldn't have decent health care in the us you would find that you have everything that everyone else has if you need an operation you might have to wait if you need something done now or you will die you will get it done today i can wait a few hours in the er while people spraying blood go first i can also wait to get a hernia fixed for a month or two so that car accident people can have their lives saved dental care orthodontics a medication are not paid for by the government they are usually covered by supplemental insurance if you have a full time job this insurance costs month for a family if you don't have supplimental insurance you would have to pay for dental orthodontics and medication by yourself when medication cost becomes a problem there are government programs to help you out after actually experiencing both systems i like the canadian system better i can get care here in the us i had the best care that could buy i was sick and we didn't have insurance when i came back to canada it turns out that i had asthma and anemia my doc in pa diagnosed me with asthma but he didn't do blood tests that found that i have anemia they were done in canada because it would have cost me hundreds of dollars please disregard the people who call universal health care communism they are indoctrinated by the health insurance companies in the us to believe that you have to pay exorbitant amounts of money to for profit companies to get decent health care all that money they charge to deny people care is used to pay billions of dollars in bonuses to upper management we don't have that problem in canada the government tries to keep the people healthy not a company trying to make profits off the sick our system isn't perfect we do have some problems we have a doctor shortage in some regions people have to wait to have non life threating conditions surgically corrected but the cons are nothing compared to the pros we have it pretty good with our health care system i'm willing to wait to get an operation because i know that nobody is being denied care for lack of insurance or inability to pay we don't have cleft palates left uncorrected i have seen people in pennsylvania with partially corrected cleft palates the us should be ashamed of that those people are not treated well by others because their families are poor and couldn't afford to have the baby child's face repaired before they went to school Life insurance Pharmaceutical company Canada Health Act Medicare
