i'm worried about my dad he's had a cough for months now it's pretty bad but he refuses to go to the doctors i've tried everything i can think of to get him there but he just told me he's fine and refused to go is it worth me persisting or should i let him do what he wants just to let you know he doesn't smoke and never has don't worry too much he probably just caught an upper respiratory infection a few months ago the resulting cough from those kinds of infections can linger for months after the other symptoms have gone away my mom used to get about one a year and her cough would last for months easy there was never anything seriously wrong with her and even when she went to the doc about it there was nothing he could do about it except prescribe her a heavy duty cough syrup if your dad feels fine otherwise it's probably nothing to worry about Pneumonia Common cold Asthma Lung cancer Pertussis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Upper respiratory tract infection Prostate cancer Group A streptococcal infection Smoke-screen Urinary incontinence Tuberculosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Bronchitis Trichinosis Transmission (medicine) Humphrey Bogart Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Theory of conduct Milton H.
