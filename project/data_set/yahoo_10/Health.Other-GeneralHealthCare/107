just went to the chiropractors for the first time have some concerns i just got home and i dont know why buy i am very freaked out the are he is concentrating on is my back and neck and when he cracked my back it was okay but then he grabbed my neck and craced it and it was the scarriest thing does it get easier to relax during these sessions also how many times do you have to go in the beginning he wants me back tomorrow so i'm wondering how many times i have to go i know i should ask him i'm just wonding if anyone would know thank you also if you have any chiropractor stories could you share them with me it depends on you for some people it gets easier but for some they will try to anticipate the adjustment and tighten up you have to relax and just let the doctor adjust your spine as for how many times you have to go in the beginning depends on what is going on with you i am wondering if the doctor has done a report of findings with you if the doc is going to do one with you tomorrow after he she reviews you exam and x rays if taken i would like to hear what he she tells you and what kind of program he she wants you on hope this helps and if you need you can message me for more help Chiropractic Blood on the Tracks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Scenes from a Memory Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Unquiet Dead Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Conspiracy (TNG episode) New Morning Prostate cancer Subluxation Cancer of the larynx The Amber Spyglass Massage Coming of Age (TNG episode) Extreme Programming Francis Crick John F.
