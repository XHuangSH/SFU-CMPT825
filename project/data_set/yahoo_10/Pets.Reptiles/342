home improvement for a snake i'm taking care of my sister's snake while she's doing a tour in south korea and i was thinking about adding a shelf inside the tank for him he's currently probably around ' long and is in i'm fairly certain a gallon tank there are four clasps on the mesh lid to keep him from getting out multiple people have watched him try for over an hour at a time and he can't get the lid off he's an albino burmese python btw if i were to do this what should i do not do and if i do this might this give him the extra help he needs to pry the lid up and thus mean that i need to better secure the lid yeah i know he's close to outgrowing it i'm waiting for my sister to get me the cash for the new tank and she's waiting for the army to fix its payroll mistakes so when the army fixes its oops he will have a bigger tank your foot snake still has plenty of time to grow out of a gal tank no need to worry about that for the shelf thing the shelf will not help him lift the lid he would have done that already if he could have or really wanted to a foot snake is a lot of snake and much taller than the tank thus leverage is on his side so what you could do is put a nice heavy branch in the tank and the snake will love you for it chances are it will turn the branch into his new bed note make sure the branch will support his weight if your not sure make a few phone calls good luck Social rule Shaggy dog story Wal-Mart Poker jargon M4 Sherman Equine conformation Jon Secada Brewery Monty Python Textile manufacturing Sea-Monkey Operation Market Garden Professional wrestling holds Betting (poker) Snake Escape from New York Microeconomics Mattress Tank Episodes of Lost (Season 1) B-47 Stratojet Time Out of Mind Python programming language Cessna T-37 Care Bears EastEnders Extreme Programming Mark I (tank) Cruising (maritime) Motorcycle The Ashlee Simpson Show Passenger car Toyota Prius Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an M60 machine gun Aerial (dance move) The Fairly OddParents GunBound Customs and etiquette of Japan Britney Spears Cannabis cultivation Rose (Doctor Who) Apollo 8 Yom Kippur War Mark VIII (tank) Kill Bill The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Fire fighting Atari ST Phonograph cylinder Japanese tea ceremony The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Burmese python 2000 Australian Grand Prix Surveillance Milton H.
