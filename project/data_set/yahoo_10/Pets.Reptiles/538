burmese python how could i get a burmese python to be more tame even when she gets to be large and if she does start to constict me how do i get her off me without be coming snake food handle it as much as possible now while it is young only thing you can do to tame it but you need to realize that these are giant constrictors and any snake from a garter to an anaconda can have a bad day and turn for no reason there is always that danger the general rule is that you need a person per every foot of snake when it comes to handling as far as being constricted by a large snake you start at the tail to unwind if you can't get it unwinded due to strength or the way you are constricted grab the tail just below the vent and bend it sharply upwards and break the tail this sounds extreme but in a life or death situation you do what you gotta do keeping a knife on hand is good practice but whether you are able to use it or not depends on how it all plays out keep rubbing alcohol on hand snakes cannot stand it and it may cause the snake to let go also submerge it in cold water if possible this works well it you got a bite and the snake won't let go stick it's head underwater they'll let go or drown lastyly remember that if it is attacking you do everything you can to get it to release fighting it by sheer strength alone will not work no one can match their power use your brain go for the eyes head etc do whatever you can to get it to release you best defense is to know your snake to watch it's moves and learn its personality if it is acting strange put it away but never let your guard down fully Snake Professional wrestling throws Drowning Professional wrestling holds Shaggy dog story Diving Burmese python Aurelian Smith, Jr. Swimming Escape from New York Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Snake charming Python Textile manufacturing Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Tenshinhan Backstroke Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Fast bowling Vegeta Blood (computer game) Knife Poker jargon Skateboarding trick Social rule Breaststroke Aikido Martial art Equine conformation Shen Gong Wu Whale Kill Bill Mixed martial arts Pikmin Rugby union positions Naruto jutsu Suicide methods Samurai Deeper Kyo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Conspiracy (TNG episode) The Amber Spyglass Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling attacks Exception handling American Alligator USS Tunny (SS-282) Welding Boxing Anaconda Laws of cricket Naval mine First aid Theory of conduct Marching band Internal ballistics Tetrapod Creatures in Bionicle Sonic the Hedgehog Drill bit Craps Burma Campaign Wing Chun Sub-Zero Nicomachean Ethics Sea serpent Movie projector Characters of Lost Glossary of nautical terms Wood carving Sailing M16 (rifle) Butterfly stroke Treehouse of Horror IX Cat Sonic the Hedgehog 3 USS Trigger (SS-237) Drag racing Python programming language Baseball Deus ex machina Uzumaki Naruto Diver rescue Piccolo Junior Saga YuYu Hakusho Races of Final Fantasy Robot Master Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Rave Master Table tennis Stone Cold Steve Austin Kasparov versus The World Whitewater One Piece minor characters Ninja Scroll
