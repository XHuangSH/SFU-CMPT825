baby ball python shedding i'm new to the shedding process so anything you can tell me would be helpful can i still hold him if he's shedding will he get agressive if i don't hold him for awhile the first stage of the shedding process is the snake's belly will turn a pinkish color and their eyes will begin turning cloudy milky usually the eyes will clear up right before the shed begins the snake's skin will turn dull or pale in most cases like a bluish color the shedding process usually takes anywhere between days sometimes longer if the humidity level is not right or if the snake is ill it is best not to handle the snake until the shedding is complete most snakes become irritated or agile while shedding and may strike or bite not always for meanness but sometimes because it really can't see you and may mistake your hand for prey also while in the shedding process the snake may refuse to eat so don't be too concerned about him missing a meal but do keep in mind that soon after the shedding is complete he should start back with his regular eating habits be sure to have something in the snake's tank that he can rub against to help with his shedding such as a rock not heated branches etc and a large enough water dish that the snake can soak in since he will spend most of his time soaking during shedding and the humidity level in the tank should be increased not too much also astro turf for the substrate is not only great for easy cleaning but it also helps with the shedding hope this helps and good luck with your ball python also just for your information in regards to the st comment i agree with all that was said but just wanted you to know why the skin on the tail if not shedded during the process should be removed because it will cause loss of circulation to the tail as well as the eye caps they should be removed because if left on can cause loss of circulation in the eyes and can cause permanent blindness Snake Textile manufacturing Cat Chicken Dairy Knife First aid Brewery Moult Fecal incontinence Social rule Hyperthermia Leopard Hera Nutrition Carbon dioxide The Contender (television series) Acne Manicure Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eye Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Spider Ouroboros Drill bit Prostate cancer Piccolo Junior Saga Dog agility Drowning Sake Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Escape from New York Garter snake Escherichia coli O157:H7 Fancy rat Infantilism Aerial (dance move) Xenomorph Tattoo American Alligator Bacon The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Garfield Shark Minor Harry Potter Beasts Psoriasis Volleyball Acorn Poker jargon Alexander Technique Thermal power station Japanese tea ceremony Son Goku (Dragon Ball) 1957 World Series Pok__mon Abilities Jon Secada Happy Tree Friends Tooth Sewage treatment Leaf Diving Characters in the Smurfs Kosher foods Thermoregulation Common cold Traffic light Croquet Insulin Tag Peter Shilton Mattress Craps Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Snake charming Professional wrestling slang Burmese python Color Sun Pysanka Vampire Shaggy dog story Crocodilia Polychrotidae American lobster Cleveland Browns Ravenloft domains Tanning Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Space Shuttle program Cheetah
