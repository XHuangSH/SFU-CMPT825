res not basking and other behaviour two weeks ago i got two baby res the smaller one about inch big seemed to settle in in a few days and started using the rock to bask and does so regularly the bigger one inch guy still isn't basking he does get up onto the rock but more of a short cut across the tank otherwise he seems healthy he likes to dig around in the stones and swim around and through the plants oh and another thing though he does seem to get particually fixated on swimming into the sides of the glass as if that's going to get him somewhere sometimes he paddles quite furiously what's that about he's about and a half inches big so he's just a baby i say he but they're so small i can't tell very well if they're girls or boys how old is the bigger one male res reach sexual maturity at age while a female doesn't till she's or this may be just frustration in looking for a mate don't worry about the basking he can absorb uv thru the water and he may be basking when you're not looking Shark Basking Shark Platypus Hamster Liger Shaggy dog story Puberty Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Kyle Broflovski Elephant EastEnders Infantilism American lobster Kodocha Orca Timeline of alternative rock Ranma __ characters Whitewater Leatherback Sea Turtle Clownfish Friends Tarantula One Piece minor characters Penis Static Shock Rod Stewart Hall & Oates The Chemical Brothers Hey Arnold!
