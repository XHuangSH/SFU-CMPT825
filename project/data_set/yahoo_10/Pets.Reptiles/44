i bought crickets at the local pet shop this afternoon to feed my anoles and they are all dead now hrs ltr i had the pet shop sprinkle calcium on the crickets before he gave them to me some were already dead by the time i got home will my anoles be dead in the morning i understand that the crickets need to be taken out of the bag and they were i live a block away from the pet store some were dead by the time i got home and now they are all of them absolutely dead the anoles ate the live ones with no problem and now i am afraid they will die too since you got crickets i assume you were planning to keep them for a long time and mabey even breed them so when you get them home you should put them in their own tank where it is cool and dark your lizzards should eat a few per day so the vitamin and mineral powder should only be put on them right at feeding time the fine powder clogs the pores that insects breathe through these insects have a hard exoskeleton and breathe through tiny holes in their shell the crickets that live in captivity should be fed high nutrition like veggies and bread wet with sugar water and mabey a slice of potato but they need it replaced with new clean food every few days so then when they are eaten by the larger critters they are healthy too a pinch of the mineral powder could be put on the wet bread or potato and then you never have to dust the crickets each feeding time the person at the pet store should be corrected for their huge mistake i think you should get a refund or replacement crickets for free remember this lizzards in the wild dont take vitamins and minerals and live long and healthy lives a little sprinkle here and there will go a long way to keep your little friends happy and healthy Hamster Polychrotidae Domestic rabbit Bread Milk Nutrition Dairy Chicken Guinea pig Sea-Monkey Diseases of the honeybee Potato Fancy rat Food One Piece minor characters Hypoglycemia Folic acid Organic food Fugu Tofu Cat Vitamin Vegetarianism Chocolate Veganism Discus (fish) Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Denmark MRE Coconut crab Toilet humour Carbon dioxide Hard water Apple Insulin Honeybee Food guide pyramid Ramen Beetle Tooth Marine aquarium Potato chips Thermal power station Domesticated turkey Spider Jewish cuisine Food preservation Crayfish Stomach cancer Soy protein Mango Baptism Acne Pet skunk Flour Moult Soybean 1957 World Series Tlingit Earthworm Coffee Tooth enamel Garlic Phelsuma 613 mitzvot Goldfish Hedgehog Tocopherol Fish farming Bagel Ant Platypus Calcium in biology Peruvian cuisine French fries Recipe Tea Water Dieting History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Soy milk Insect Doughnut Chili con carne Calcium Date Palm Honey Marmite Elephant Laws of cricket Acorn Breakfast Bong
