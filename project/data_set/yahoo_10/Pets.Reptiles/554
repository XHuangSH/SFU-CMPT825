tank size for a hatchling corn snake i've been wanting to get a snake for many years and within the past six months or so after researching online i've decided on the corn snake my question is would a gal be too intimidating to a hatchling corn snake some sites say gal long is perfect others that it is minimum but bigger is better some say to start with a small tank and upgrade as the snake grows up others that it isn't necessary since in the wild the snakes obviously have quite a large space to live in i'd rather not have to buy more than one cage if necessary which is why i'd like to just buy the gal instead of starting small so my question is to the corn snake owners here what do you think will the hatchling be okay in the large tank or will he need a smaller one to start with would he be fine in the larger tank if i provided plenty of ground cover and hides i think a large tank with plenty of foliage and hiding places would be fine for a young corn snake naturally snakes in the wild would have plenty of room to roam around and i would think that a bigger tank would encourage the snake to move about his surroundings i have never found starting a young cornsnake in a bigger tank to be a problem and have talked with other snake owners who start hatchlings out in a bigger tank upgrading as the snake gets bigger is always an option however i think more people do that because they only have smaller tanks to start off will a gallon tank should be enough room for your snake for a lifetime of happiness and it will give him plenty of time to get used to his habitat for my corn snake i used a coconut rind bedding that comes in a brick like form you just soak it and add it to the cage it allows the snake to burrow and i have found it to be most successful personally i think it would be less stressful if you started him in the bigger one than if you were to constantly upgrade into new homes Hamster Shaggy dog story Zerg Chicken Coconut crab Super Metroid Poker jargon RuneScape quests Toyota Prius Escape from New York Tank Domestic rabbit Thermal power station Samus Aran Nile crocodile Maize Fancy rat Leopard tank Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dairy Solid Snake Wood carving Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Space Shuttle external tank Gallon Fish farming Surveillance Rice Laptop Chinchilla Alcohol fuel The Legend of Zelda series enemies Leopard Brewery Space Shuttle program Social rule Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Betting (poker) E85 Terran (StarCraft) Marine aquarium M.C.
