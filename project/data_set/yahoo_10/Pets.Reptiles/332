corn snake seems aggressive or agitated during the past week i have a corn snake that seems to be agrivated dring the past week i took it outside to slither around for a while and when id pick him up to move him away from the bushes he'd tense up and hiss at me i also noticed he is bleeding from where he poops i'm not sure if it's a male or female so i was wondering if it might be menstruating i don't know the cycles of a snake or if they even do have periods during the time of year they would usually be mating i don't know when snakes do mate aslo i had the lid to his cage sitting on my bed with a frozen mouse sitting on the lid to thaw i was playing a video game with the snake around my shoulders not paying attention and he got the frozen mouse so i was thinking maybe that could have caused some damage to his body i'm hoping thats not the case though i would really appreciate some help ive had the snake for over a year i think a year and a half it's on this green felt stuff they sell in pet stores for snakes plus he's no safer in your hands than he is on the ground it's just as dirty if not worse snakes natural habitat is on the ground i'm sure that has nothing to do with the problem and i dont appreciate your response i know i made a mistake with the frozen mouse which was still mostly frozen but it was an accident i've already called an exotic vet to come to my house because no places around here do snakes but i'm only interested in the response of someone who's going to tell me the answeres to my questions not toss around their oppinions of me well with the slithering around on the ground thing i don't know i only let him slither around on my driveway wich is all little stones he really seems to enjoy himself when i take him out though that's why i do it i like giving him a chance to stretch out and i'm sure he likes it too his previous owner took him outside too that's where i got the idea he has never acted like this to me before either he was an aggresive snake before i got him said his previous onwer and he'd even bite her and her sister he has never bitten me though never even flicked his tale besides the first few days i had him he's about to feet long i'm not sure how old he is though he just shed about or days ago then got the mouse a day or so after that so or days ago but when he was acting agitated with me i was kind of afriad to pick him up because if the mouse did cause damage i dont want to hurt him more but like i said i have called an exotci vet and she's on her way tomorrow i talked to the vet she looked at the snake and said everything was fine she said the frozen mouse it ate should have thawed enough inside the snake to avoid causing any damage because my room is always in the lower to mid 's she said the snake wasn't bleeding it's just the color of the scales and the way the light hits it when you apply a little pressure to the area i forgot what she called it where he poops i think it started with a t i can't believe i've never noticed it before she said he's a very healthy corn and i set up his habbitat perfect but i might want to think about investing in a larger tank it is currently l ' x w ' x depth is foot i'm not sure how many gallons that is but i'm gonna go quite a bit bigger and try to get another corn snake or i have definately learned from my mistake though from now on the snake stays in the cage until the mouse is completely thawed not to be rude but you really do not need a snake if he she is bleeding something is wrong it could be serious not knowing what kind of bedding you are using for the tank i would say it could be an impaction you really need to take this snake to the vet he should have never been put on the ground that is a good way for him to pick up parasites if the mouse was still pretty frozen you could end up with a dead snake if it was thawed completely you are lucky Hamster Shaggy dog story Social rule Guinea pig Fancy rat Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.
