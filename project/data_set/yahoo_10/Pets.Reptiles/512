what to get what reptile or amphibian makes a great pet i'm open to everything as a year old no animal is too strange well within reason i would like additional info as to why you say what you say but any reply is fine i particularly like the idea of salamanders and geckos someone recommended bearded dragons and they are a great choice chinese water dragons would be a good choice as well though they are a little prone to mouth rot there are a number of kinds of geckos that would be very good first time reptiles as well leopard geckos would be a good choice they are fun to watch and easy to care for while they can be handled they may not enjoy being held as much as some other reptiles if you want something that you can play with look to schneider skinks the are fun active little lizards that love to be handled they seem to like sitting on your head they have a lot of personality and are very easy to care for while you can keep salamanders they are a little more difficult and not necessarily a great choice for beginners in addition they are not the type of pet that you can frequently handle good luck on your choice i hope your new pet brings you years of happiness Lizard Endangered species Gecko Pet Gerald Durrell Reptile Hamster Crocodilia Amphibian Fauna of Australia Tetrapod Dragon Salamander Cryptozoology Care Bears Leopard gecko Goodness and value theory Domestic rabbit Yixian Formation Sinfest Reptile (Mortal Kombat) Strap-on dildo Taikyoku shogi Gradius Five-lined Skink Meat Tung Chung Pitaten Animal Theodicy Dinosaur Tuatara Axolotl Human sexual behavior Gecko (layout engine) Neopets Theory of conduct Fast bowling Shaggy dog story Exotic pet Minor Harry Potter Beasts Monster Rancher monsters Eumeces Social rule Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cat Lizard (comics) Biodiversity of New Zealand Skat MapleStory Parthenogenesis Rat Mid-levels Ed, Edd n Eddy Snake charming Expert system Nicomachean Ethics Dog Phelsuma RuneScape quests Fancy rat Bearded Dragon Pet skunk Predestination Monkey (zodiac) Pet store Tai shogi Fruits Basket Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Ron Weasley Tooth enamel Xiaolin Showdown Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) American Alligator Goanna Sheepshead Alignment (role-playing games) Charge (heraldry) Labrador Retriever Keeshond Creatures in Bionicle Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME French Defence Azumanga Daioh Dragon boat Akatsuki (Naruto) Dog training Avenue Q Monitor lizard Rubeus Hagrid Tattoo Upholstery Chinese character Tank Password The Pet Sounds Sessions Beatmania IIDX Flood geology Anchor Star Trek Customizable Card Game
