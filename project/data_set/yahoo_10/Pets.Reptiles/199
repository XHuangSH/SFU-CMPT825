anorexic leopard gecko is there something i haven't thought of she's been like this for months and months i made a total change in husbandry she has spent the summer on the balcony sun and cool shade available earlier on i was syringe feeding her more recently i've been putting globs of baby food on her nose for her to lick off her favourite food has always been waxworms i put some in a transparent dish for her every few days but she never eats i don't know what to do anymore what can i do to give her an appetite substrate impaction not possible she's kept on indoor outdoor carpet she has various hides in the cage all at varying temps i stopped the syringe feeding a couple of months ago when i got the idea to glob babyfood on the end of her nose i am aware that both techniques are stressful but it must be done she absolutely refuses to eat i forgot to add i give her live food she is years old and has always been fat and healthy i think there are a couple possibilities gut impaction caused by the leo eating substrate intestinal parasites some other disease bacterial infection i have reptiles too and i can see your concern you should take her to the vet to get an inspection if it's parasites ask about panacur it's for pigeons but it should work as a dewormer in correct dosage but first order of business would be to make an appointment with a vet and maybe do some research on different appetite stimulants hope your gecko feels better l ld Nutrition Anorexia nervosa Fancy rat Myxobolus cerebralis Breastfeeding Domestic rabbit Insulin Stomach cancer Guinea pig Diseases of the honeybee Malaria Pet skunk Livestock Crohn's disease Gecko Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obesity Diarrhea Food Glucocorticoid Vitamin C Chicken Allergy Shark Horse colic Foodborne illness Brain Cat Vegetarianism Common cold Swimming Chocolate Gastroparesis Tasmanian Devil Garfield Global warming Dog Veganism Coeliac disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Carnivorous plant Sewage treatment Dieting Toxoplasmosis Earthworm Bacteria Cirrhosis Folic acid Chagas disease Domesticated turkey Organic farming Oral sex Cannabis (drug) Hamster Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Dairy Egg (food) Hamburger Asthma Gypsy moth Genetically modified food Tsetse fly DDT Bread Milk Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Weekly World News Omega-3 fatty acid Eye Vampire Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Ulcerative colitis Glucokinase Chlorophyta Clinical depression Animal testing Ferret Spanish flu Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Coprophagia Ascariasis Apple Beetle Equine conformation Discus (fish) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Low-carbohydrate diet Koala Tocopherol Ecology AIDS Daylight saving time
