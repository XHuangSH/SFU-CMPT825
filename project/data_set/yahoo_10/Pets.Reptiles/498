i am wanting to breed crickets need an oppinion though i did some research on how to breed crickets but most of them have a picture of a lid on the little nesting container with a hole cut in the top with some screen so they can stick the ovipositor the long stinger looking thing on their bottom through the screen and lay the eggs in the damp soil but most of the breeders said to leave the top on it but i don't understand do to the fact that what happens when they sprout they will be trapped so what should i do i think you should leave the lid on until they sprout then take it off Textile manufacturing Honeybee Bee Chicken Mouse (computing) Ant Diseases of the honeybee Hamster Africanized bee Monster Rancher monsters Golf Sequoia Platypus Beehive (beekeeping) Top-bar hive Potato Minor Harry Potter Beasts Chernobyl accident Osprey Apocrita Jennifer Lopez Origins of baseball Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Robot Wars Condor Gray Wolf Sea turtle Mosquito Dobermann Resident Evil: Apocalypse Ostrich Buckfast bee Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker 2005 English cricket season Seabird Tin can House Sparrow Tarantula Sandpit Gypsy moth Agriculture Wasp Grasshopper Hemp Heraldry Nepenthes Swarming (honeybee) 2003 Cricket World Cup Netsuke Pringles Cockroach European Rabbit Anopheles Peregrine Falcon Percula Clownfish Sea-Monkey Giant Sequoia The Ark in Space Tea Brood (honeybee) Capercaillie Resident Evil (film) John Cage Organic food Naval mine Drone (bee) Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Double the Fist Distribution board Fire fighting Cannabis cultivation Aluminum can Elevator House Mouse Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tobacco Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Gharial Drill bit Humphrey Bogart Digimon Wood Stork Diatom Mountain Plover Australian cricket team Pinball Fujian tea ceremony American Pit Bull Terrier Symphyta Chinese tea Marilyn Monroe Professional wrestling attacks Rigging Eggerland series History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Diving suit Alien vs. Predator (film) Sydney Riot of 1879 Sushi
