snake owners i want a snake really badly and i've been wondering what the up and downsides of having one are do they really stink up the house is it safe to have a poisonous snake what kind of snake makes the best pet these are just a few of my questions so please give me as much info as you can is it safe to have a poisonous snake o honey just read over the question i think you'll find the answer on your own only professional herpetologists should attempt to keep poisonous snakes snakes don't have odors if the snake tank smells then you're neglecting it the best pet snake is the ball python very docile and slow moving they are one of the most hesitant species to strike they're a little more expensive than a corn or king snake but overall i like their personalities much better snakes are not like cats and dogs they don't love you and don't yearn for you to pet them in their minds they are wild animals i'm not saying there can't be a bond between a snake and its owner they can trust when you first buy a snake it'll be pretty expensive you'll need all the necessary equipment and then the snake itself plus vet bills if the snake hasn't recently been to one once you have all those things though day to day owning a snake isn't very expensive despite what so many claim you can get any snake to feed on thawed rodents it's just a matter of finding out how they want it took me two months with my rescue ball python fun fun fun a lot of people don't want reptiles because they're afraid they'll get salmonella while it is possible you're far more likely to get it from bad meat and dairy products follow a few simple rules and you'll be fine keep the snake's tank clean scrub out its water bowl every day don't lick kiss or otherwise put any part of the snake in your mouth lol don't put your hands near your mouth after holding your snake wash your hands well before and after holding the snake just as they can transfer salmonella onto our hands we can transport harmful chemicals onto them keep both yourself and the snake safe this next one could be good or bad depending on the owner snakes live an average of yrs ball pythons can live up to yrs if you don't think you'll be able to keep a snake that long don't buy one there are already thousands of snakes out there without homes don't add anothe to the list that's some of the pros and cons i really thoroughly enjoy my pet snakes Cat Hamster Snake Pet skunk Snake charming Shaggy dog story Foodborne illness Ferret Skunk Social rule Theory of conduct RuneScape quests Donald Rumsfeld Fancy rat Garfield Guinea pig Dairy V.F.D.
