red tailed boa i'm going to get a boa in september it's going to be a baby red tailed boa should i give it pinkies or when it gets bigger rats what should i give it how often and when when should i change how much of what it eats thanks for all of the help it sounds like this is your first snake i would suggest purchasing a book on red tail boa's for just that sort of info and make sure you have a reputible rodent supply the breeder should have some good answers for this too i have not had a red tail boa but from my experience you will start with pinkies but only for a few weeks snakes grow quickly fuzzies are also brief all of which you can easily feed live and i would recomend doing so offer food once a week if the snake is eagerly eating one within minutes every week or eating two then go up to the next size but use caution snakes are opportunistic feeders and will overeat you usually want to give the snake as big a mouse as it will eat at a year it will probably be on full grown mice then on to small rats eventually adult rats will be needed about once a month depending on size of rats and activity level Hamster Fancy rat Shen Gong Wu Rat Cat House Mouse Brown Rat Guinea pig Breastfeeding Snake BoA The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Capercaillie Mouse Kitten Squirrel Chicken Chinese New Year Fauna of Australia Kangaroo Laotian Rock Rat Hedgehog Red Fox Dieting Pet store My Little Pony Hall & Oates Franz Boas Gray Wolf Boa The Secret of NIMH Rodent Extreme Programming Creatures in Bionicle Domestic rabbit Super Size Me The Little Prince American Alligator Bamboo rat Long-term potentiation Britney Spears Porcupine Dog Flea Pit viper Biological pest control Eastern Gray Squirrel Anthropology $ale of the Century Garter snake Folic acid Tooth Aspartame Animal Discus (fish) Elephant Tocopherol Pinky and the Brain Pesticide Taboo food and drink Nile crocodile Kangaroo rat Cultural relativism Mario Gypsy moth Ball python American lobster Meaning of life Stomach cancer Virginia Military Institute Shaggy dog story Goanna Atkins Nutritional Approach Alcohol fuel Margaret Mead Metaphysics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Heinkel He 100 Genetically modified food Baldrick Pet skunk Opportunity rover Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stem cell RuneScape quests Hypoglycemia Conker's Bad Fur Day Colorectal cancer Moult Stoat Narnia Burrowing Owl Murinae Meat Fasting Beaver Dragon boat Ferret Tasmanian Devil
