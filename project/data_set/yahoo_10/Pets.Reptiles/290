i want to add a hermit crab to my pet family are they really hard to keep what do i need can i have them in my room what do they eat and are they expensive i have a puppy pug and two sugar gliders but i want a hermit crab or a turtle a turtle would be far more upkeep than a hermit crab you can keep a hermit crab in a gallon tank add some sand some shells some food and water and you are pretty much set keep a soaking wet sponge in a dish at all times so it always has a fresh supply of water turtles are a whole different story there are land turtles and aquatic turtles just to buy the turtle can cost you a lot oh and with the hermit crab i recommend something like a gallon aquarium but with a mesh top something that keeps other creatures out in case they somehow gain access hope this helps Hermit crab Coconut crab Fishing Marine aquarium Fauna of Australia Turtle Aquarium Finding Nemo Common bean Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Apple Creatures in Bionicle Hamster Tooth Crayfish Octopus Goldfish Lobster Tilapia Animal Sea anemone Biodiesel Bikini Bottom Concrete Crab Kosher foods Shrimp farm Cajun cuisine Cantonese cuisine Japanese cuisine Hydrogen economy Halibut Ramen Tofu Corcovado National Park Microeconomics Plastic Sea-Monkey Peruvian cuisine Bread Snapping turtle Leatherback Sea Turtle Sonic Heroes Chinchilla Domestic rabbit Gal__pagos Islands Cuisine of Singapore Beach Fish Cuisine of Brazil Jellyfish Cuisine of the Philippines Water Coffee Guild Wars Atari 8-bit family Cruising (maritime) Idli Autonomous building Rum Dairy Fossil fuel power plant Reef tank Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Cookware and bakeware Water (classical element) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Goby Hard water Tax Shedd Aquarium Porcelain crab Snail New England Aquarium Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Fancy rat SpongeBob SquarePants Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Franklin (television series) Dry cleaning Tooth enamel Egg (food) Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Titanium American Chinese cuisine Pet store Soup Iron Dog Gerald Durrell Sauerkraut Shellfish Zebra Danio Otter Arthropod American Alligator Car washing techniques
