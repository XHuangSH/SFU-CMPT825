i have a year old ball python that i am trying to convert to frozen food i have been feeding him live mice for years with no troubles please don't scold me about this i know the dangers and never leave a live mouse unattended in my habitat but he is getting to big for just mice and the price for one is getting to be outrageous and i do not want to give him a live rat as there are bigger dangers than a little mouse i have no trouble pre killing a rat i just don't know what methods to use i have the patience to convert him i just really don't know how fear not o i rescued a three year old ball python that had only been given live food and i converted him to frozen there are many methods you can use so let me list a few that i tried note i just buy frozen mice from the petshop grins no i don't use frozen rats i've had pet rats and just can't find it in me to feed him rats my sister had mice i hated them no dilemma there i just give him two mice per feeding instead of one moving the dead prey back and forth in front of the snake's face with tongs not your hands kaa the python didn't like this at all as he was basically frightened of any kind of movement came from a really bad home put the mouse in one of the snake's favorite places to hide and leave it there overnight this didn't work either for kaa i came down in the morning to find he had shoved it across the cage into the opposite corner plus it smelled really bad by that point ugh that brings me to another freezing and thawing a rodent repeatedly so it gets old and has a sort of rotting smell some snake like there to be a strong scent to their food shrugs i tried this one and in my own opinion keep this as one of your last options face slightly green yeah try to cover up the freezer and dead smells some people rub the dead animal on a live rodent kinda disturbing for the live animals i know so it smells like a live rodent i also tried cutting the mouse open along the head braining but kaa freaked out and wouldn't touch it a breeder i spoke to numerous times who coached me through this when i was ready to give up said he'd heard of people dipping the mouse in something like chicken broth to cover the dead scent and give a more desirable smell mmm chicken flavored mouse my favorite xd now this is the one that worked for me it's especially popular with ball pythons due to their shy eating behaviors turns out kaa's just a really shy eater even though he'd always eaten live prey before weird snake pythons like closed in spaces in my own opinion try this one first get a brown paper grocery bag and put the thawed warm dead prey item in it place the bag in the snake's cage standing upright put the snake inside the bag with the prey item fold the top of the bag over so you can't see the snake and it can't see out close and latch the cage top and make sure nothing disturbs the snake when he's done eating he'll easily be able to escape the bag and go into his favorite hiding place don't try to peek in to see if he's done if he doesn't want to eat he'll climb out of the bag leaving the dead rodent in there important note pythons have very slow metabolisms i've met people whose pythons stopped eating for months to a year the owner shouldn't fret unless they note that their snake is losing weight then and only then is it a problem kaa's previous owners fed him a few days before i got him for the first two months i had him he refused to eat as he remained the bulky muscular physique ball pythons should have i didn't worry shuffles okay so i did but only a little only a tiny bit yeah okay screw it i was worried for someone who'd had rabbits rodents and dogs all her life having a pet refuse to eat for two months was just a bit unnerving if none of these tips work or if you have any questions feel free to email me i've got some more pointers but hopefully the paper bag one should work good luck Shaggy dog story Snake Dog Domestic rabbit Trapping Dog training Mouse (computing) Escape from New York RuneScape quests Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chicken Equine conformation Sin City Poker jargon W.I.T.C.H.
