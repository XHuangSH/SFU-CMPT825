what to do when my ball python is very alert to movement and is flicking his tounge very fast well my month old ball python just finished shedding on and last monday i held him for a while with no problem then i fed him last tuesday this past saturday i went to clean out his tank and clean his furniture because he had pooped on it but when i reached in to get him he was very alert and kinda in strike position so i changed his water and left him alone he was so alert that everytime i passed the glass he would follow me since his tounge was flicking very fast i figured he may still be hungry so i fed him again yesterday was that the correct response to his behavior what can i do to prevent that behavior from happening again yes from what you described your snake was hungry a young ball python should eat every to days although he may refuse food while he is in shed mode you should keep a log on your animal and after a while you will see a pattern develop it helps you tell if something is wrong or just lets you know when to expect certain things ex shed ate medium rat ate medium rat crapped then around the middle of july you will notice his belly getting pink his skin getting dull then his eyes clouding up then clearing up then finally he sheds mark all these events down and you will be way ahead of the husbandry game you can purchase a great snake log program from www degei com check it out i find it very helpful but i keep a paper log because it's faster then when i have time i transfer the data to the computer also make sure that you are giving him an adequate sized meal the rodent should be at least as large as the widest part of your snakes body and can actually be a half size larger at years old you should be feeding it small rats i find that there is more nutrition in rats than mice and your snake will grow at a nice pace at almost years old my ball is just under feet and likes to eat every days now she eats medium rats that are pushing the large size good luck you chose a great snake to get into the hobby with i suggest that you visit www bobclark com and join the forum there lots and lots of great information and experienced as well as novice snake people Hamster Snake Fancy rat Fasting CPU cache Fast bowling Quicksort Mouse (computing) Guinea pig Shark Fecal incontinence Rugby union positions Dairy Toilet humour Baseball Shit Collision detection The Amazing Race Debugging Snooker Domestic rabbit Volleyball Electrophysiology RuneScape quests Swingout Pitaten Solar variation Anorexia nervosa Rugby league positions Chicken CPU design Tai shogi Raw food diet Paintball Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Folic acid Compiler optimization Rat Theory of conduct Binge eating disorder Bubonic plague USS Tunny (SS-282) Web crawler IBM PC compatible Ken Jennings Game programming Velvet Revolution Computer virus Hash table Drag racing The Contender (television series) Shaggy dog story BitTorrent History of Test cricket (to 1883) Expert system Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Little Britain 2003 North America blackout Sea-Monkey Jumpstart 3rd Grade Craps Tarantula Aerial (dance move) Pet skunk Parachuting Animal testing Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Python programming language Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Trapping Dai dai shogi Deep Impact (space mission) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March 2000 Australian Grand Prix Poker jargon Spider Dog agility Sin City Deluge (mythology) Stomach cancer Escape from New York Acorn Nutrition
