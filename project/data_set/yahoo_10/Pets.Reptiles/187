leopard gecko what should i use for heating a leopard gecko's tank if i use a under tank heater do i only put it on one side and leave the other side alone if i use the under tank heater do i need to use a lightbulb yes you only want to put the under tank heater on one side that way there is a warm size a cool side to the tank the gecko can decide where it wants to be on the temperature gradient no need to use a lightbulb for a leopard gecko they are nocturnal so don't need the uv like many other reptiles do and the under tank heater will provide the heat needed so no light is needed Autonomous building HVAC Gecko Leopard Leopard tank Water heater Leopard gecko Aquarium Thermostat Diesel engine Fossil fuel power plant Solar collector Furnace Leopard 2 Thermal power station Vacuum tube Peltier-Seebeck effect Tank Solar panel Apollo 13 Refrigerator Energy Incandescent light bulb Tank classification Temperature Reef tank Panzer II Reptile Thermoregulation Nocturnal animal Brewery Convection Chevrolet Corvair Bi-metal Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Mercury Atlas 6 Insulation M1 Abrams Fire fighting Spacecraft propulsion Madagascar day gecko Space manufacturing Lizard Passive solar Torpedo Imperial stormtrooper Dialysis Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Operation Barbarossa Gas metal arc welding Marine aquarium Mars Exploration Rover Wind High explosive anti-tank P-38 Lightning Hydrogen economy Power station Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Cruising (maritime) Smoke-screen Avalanche Carbon dioxide Nuclear power Heating element Lightbulb joke Ford Ranger EV Injection moulding Tank locomotive Warm-blooded Sun Heat pump Sauna Chevrolet Corvair engine Precipitation (meteorology) Thermocouple Heat Ocean thermal energy conversion Helium Fan (implement) Heat sink Silicon Soldering iron Hot air balloon Heat equation Tung Chung Leopard Cat Urban heat island Nuclear reactor Rail terminology Process control Home repair Hybrid vehicle Heat conduction Paleocene Houseplant T-80 Nuclear weapon design
