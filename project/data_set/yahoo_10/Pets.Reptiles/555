help on my iguana i stepped on my baby iguana and a bubble popped out its butt and it went back in an hour later i think it was its guts but she still ate after that but now its been about a week and she is very sick and looks a brownish i got some antibiotic and dont know if i should let her have a little or just feed her to my ball python to take her out her misery is there anything i can do to help her i think you know the answer to your own question do what any resonable person would do and take it to a vat asap don't diagnose the problem yourself as from what you have written you don't seem capable now i am not having ago at you stepping on it accidents happen and i am willing to give you the benifit of the doubt but not taking it to a vet is animal abuse it does sound like a prolaps which if left long enough will be fatal if the bowl is left out side of the body too long it will dry and die which will need an operation to correct and remove part of her bowl if it is caught quick enough it can some times be re positioned inside the body with little ill effects i would say if it has been a week then it is unlikely to be able to be repositioned and there for surgery will be required and you are lucky you won't be charged with animal abuse Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Guinea pig Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Volleyball Ravi Shastri Sant Thakar Singh Aerial (dance move) Stomach cancer Decompression sickness Cricket Casting Atrial septal defect Super Bowl XXVII Urinary incontinence Laws of cricket Jennifer Lopez Fecal incontinence Fancy rat Fast bowling Social rule Prostate cancer Quizbowl Chronic fatigue syndrome Cat Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 New York Giants Anthrax Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Dairy Scientology beliefs and practices Radiation poisoning Coeliac disease Traumatic brain injury Animal Escherichia coli O157:H7 Breech birth Pneumonia Insulin Magical thinking Mitral valve prolapse Diarrhea Botulism Ferret Stroke Toilet humour Folic acid The Ashes Penis Mad Money Super Bowl XXV The Apprentice 2 Super Bowl XXXIV Abortion debate Expert system Glossary of American football Game show Jon Secada Value added tax Gwen Stefani Japanese tea ceremony Batting (cricket) Legends of the Hidden Temple Rabies Aortic dissection Violin Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger Glossary of partner dance terms Four square Chernobyl accident EastEnders English cricket team Abstraction (computer science) Transsexuality Time Out of Mind Cancer Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 The Sims 2 Breast cancer Adjustable gastric band The Ashlee Simpson Show Drug test The Time Machine Traumatic incident reduction Traditional Chinese medicine Strap-on dildo Kodocha Rocky Mountain spotted fever Blonde on Blonde Kenny McCormick Biological warfare Cleveland Browns Max Martin Chiropractic Have I Got News For You Syringomyelia West Indian cricket team Skateboarding trick Psoriasis Columbine High School massacre
