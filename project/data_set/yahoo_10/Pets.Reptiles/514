can i put in turtle clean with my turtle still in the tank i got this new product that's called turtle clean can i put that in the tank with my turtle still in it or should i take him out i use turtle clean too it's a really good product it's fine to put it in when the turtle is in the tank but you'll want to dilute it in water first if this is your first time using the turtle clean i'd suggest doing a partial water change in your tank take out about half the water add the turtle clean to the new water you put in this shouldn't disturb the turtle too much check the bottle but i think you'll need to add one teaspoon per gallons of water be sure to base that on the total amount of water in the tank for the initial use not just the new water next time you clean the tank or add water just use the maintenance dosage i find that when using turtle clean you don't need to clean the whole tank nearly as often but you may still go through a lot of filter cartridges since it breaks down the waste and a lot of it gets into the filter Brewery Dry cleaning Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Water purification Hydrogen economy Motor oil E85 Aquarium Autonomous building Dialysis Wine making Hydrogen vehicle Biodiesel Taikyoku shogi Rum Dairy Fire extinguisher Thermal power station Energy development Dishwasher Cruising (maritime) Propeller Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Coffee Nuclear power PID controller Champagne (beverage) Textile manufacturing M60 machine gun Turtle Beaches of Hong Kong Fire fighting Concentration Depleted uranium Volume Bhopal disaster Vinegar Gasoline Water Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Nuclear fallout Carburetor Flush toilet Microeconomics Sulfuric acid Home repair Environmental concerns with electricity generation Mark I (tank) Social rule B-47 Stratojet Logo programming language Tank Leatherback Sea Turtle Sea-Monkey Slow sand filter bed Milk Hydrogen peroxide Fish farming Sugar beet Bong The Turtles Fossil fuel power plant Reef tank Three Mile Island Cannabis cultivation Thermal depolymerization Camping (computer gaming) The Apprentice 2 Shrimp farm Automobile emissions control BZFlag Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze Sewer Apollo 8 Tea Space Shuttle program Japanese toilet Essential oil Homebrewing Internal ballistics Town gas Toyota Prius Electrophysiology Menstrual cup M1 Abrams Water (molecule) Snapping turtle Tank locomotive F-16 Fighting Falcon P-47 Thunderbolt Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour Hydrochloric acid Honda CX series MS-06 Zaku II Vickers Valiant NEWater
