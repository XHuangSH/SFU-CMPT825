i have a red eared slider and i would like to know if it is ok to use tap water in their tank should i use purified or tap water do not use distilled water or bottled water distilled water is probably unhealthy and bottled water is an unnecessary expense just get a bottle of chlorine remover and follow the instructions on the label to dechlorinate tap water you can get it at any pet store or maybe even walmart by the fish i've never heard of anyone using bottled water for that it's preposterous good luck oh yeah the best way i found to make sure the water is at the right temperature is to have a heater in the tank with the turtles when you change the water keep them in a little water make sure they can't jump out or drown then after the water is replaced let it sit with the heater and the filter pump on until the thermometer something else you should buy shows the right temperature range i forgot what temperature it should be but you can look that up online then put the turtles back and dump the rest of the water make sure you have a reptile light with a timer on the tank also because turtles need light to be healthy good luck Marine aquarium Autonomous building Water purification Aquarium Sea-Monkey Brewery Refrigerator Fossil fuel power plant Water Sewage treatment Thermoregulation Acetic acid Coffee Single malt Scotch Hydrogen peroxide Scotch whisky Plastic Polyethylene terephthalate Beer Axolotl Leatherback Sea Turtle Reef tank Rum Reptile Thermostat Motor oil Hydrogen economy Mercury (element) Discus (fish) Titanium Bottled water Swimming pool Cruising (maritime) Water supply Thermal power station Wal-Mart B-47 Stratojet Fractional distillation Energy Bong Goldfish Dairy Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Apollo 13 Alcoholic beverage Shaggy dog story Sake Fountain Neopets Polychlorinated biphenyl Ecco the Dolphin Bathing Platypus Gasoline Hyperthermia Brewing Incandescent light bulb HVAC Hydroponics Transformer Dialysis Temperature PID controller Guinness Energy development Diesel engine Cider Programmable logic controller Wine making Tetrapod Water heater Ammonia Water (molecule) American Alligator Logo programming language Siphon Tuatara Domestic water system Town gas GunBound Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Chlorine Irrigation Domestic rabbit Snapping turtle Fish farming Customs and etiquette of Japan Portable stove Yohoho!
