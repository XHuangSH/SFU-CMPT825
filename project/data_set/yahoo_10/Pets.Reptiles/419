yes i already knew geckos get rid of bugs how can i really get rid of them i would rather pay the pest control more often to get rid of bugs then to always have geckos running around so if anyone has a good solution feel free oh and i know there harmless i don t care and can t help it they freak me out thanks i understand that moth balls repel them but they stink so maybe anything with camphor like tiger balm laxman rekha use glue traps and baygon spray to kill bugs that they feed on rid yourself of bugs and i am sure they won't stick around glue boards are supposed to work but then you will have a live stuck lizard and that's gross bleach and other antiseptic cleaners like lysol triclosan etc will not only keep them from walking but in certain area but control anything they might carry they have salmonella like all reptiles egg shells apparently work get a cat a bunch of peacock feathers they don't like feathers or sprayed them with cold water so you can catch them that causes them to lose their grip and land wherever and become slow and sluggish so easy to catch cage and relocate Mosquito Snake Dinosaur RuneScape quests Carnivorous plant Minor Harry Potter Beasts Mario Bros.
