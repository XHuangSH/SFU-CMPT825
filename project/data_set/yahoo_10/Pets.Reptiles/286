does anyone know anyone that is looking for a new home for a tortoise i live in london and am looking to adopt a tortoise that is need of a new home can give a small donation would like a hermann or spur thigh if possible have everything ready tortoise table outdoor run etc if person will deliver will pay petrol money thanks i think that if you can own this kind of animal responsibly then you could approach the rspca or any animal centres as they often have exotic pets that have been abandoned by people who have paid for one and cant look after it or cant be bothered with the responsibility i think some of the answers you have had are not taking you seriously here and i dont know why but ignore them what i will say though is find out about bacteria these kind of animals can carry i used to have a red earred terrapin i gave him away because of the risk of the bacteria as i have a little boy who probably would have messed with it kids and aquatics dont go together and if we handled him we had to wash our hands as he carried bacteria which could make us ill so thats something to look into oh and lifespan is a biggie as some breeds can outlive people i do wish i'd kept mine though as he was beautiful but i found a good home for him and i didnt ask for money cos it was enough to know someone would love him like i did anyway good luck and i hope i've helped even though i havent got what you're looking for Tortoise Singlish American Red Cross Foodborne illness Domestic rabbit Pitaten The Notorious B.I.G.
