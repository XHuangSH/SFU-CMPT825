i found a bearded dragon outside while babysitting i found a bearded dragon basking in the sun on their concrete sidewalk eventually caught it and brought it home i've researched via internet what they're supposed to eat and everything but i was wondering could you identify what type of beardie it is http i photobucket com albums n iloveaustinf rnadom gardenbeardievids jpg http i photobucket com albums n iloveaustinf rnadom gardenbeardievids jpg is it too thin if it's possible to tell does it look healthy what should i watch out for and has this happened to anyone else lol it's inches long and also i read in a bearded dragon book that you could put one end of the cage in a window and the other in a shadier part and it would do the part of a heat lamp plus have uvb rays has anyone done this i live in fl he's definitely not native lol looks like a pogona vitticeps in a citrus flame color morph he's definitely way too skinny and the window thing would be nice and it would save money but uv rays can't pass through glass so he would get the heat but not the uv rays if it got hot enough then you might be able to use your window for your main source of heat but i would recommend getting a repti sun currently the best for uv requirements the repti sun is good too you knew what kind of lizard it was so i'm assuming you're not completely new to beardies here is a good website though http pets groups yahoo com group pogona it's a yahoo group for beardie owners and it has breeders on there too so they are awesome at answering any questions you have and you can learn a lot just by looking at their previous posts it doesn't look healthy but i think that's just because it's too thin and i'm not too sure you can tell if it's healthy just by looking at it if it's active and alert then those are good signs but a vet would probably be your best bet our reptile vet here ohio only costs for a general exam so i don't think that's too bad to answer your last question wow nope i don't think i've ever found a beardie in the wild although i have known people here locally to find iguanas and large pet snakes in dumpsters where people just didn't want them or couldn't take care of them any more and literally just threw them out good luck i hope you can get this guy fattened up if you want to check out my profile and look at my previous answer it's got a lot of beardie info in it that you might find useful poor guy he looks just like my youngest but skinny mine are pigs oh i just realized how big he is at his or her size pinkies are ok especially for beardies that need some extra weight you can get them from the pet store you will want a mouse pinkie they are smaller than rat pinkies i've also read that some worms are more fattening than others pinkies are supposed to be an occasional treat because they are super fattening but yours looks like it could use some fat so i would give him one once to twice a week mine get them once a month and you can get them frozen so you just let them thaw and then give them to the beardie if you don't have the heart to give them live pinkies and it's definitely old enough to be sexed http www repticzone com articles sexingbeardeddragons html if it's a female is it possible that she may have just laid a clutch of eggs this would account for her being so skinny just a thought edit i was just reading your first answer and they said no water but i read another answer that says your beardie looks a little dehydrated and i would be more inclined to lean that way my beardies get sprayed with warm water and they get soaks in the sink so they can stay hydrated i would definitely soak him in the sink or tub a little he was right about the fireflies though i've read stories of beardies eating fireflies and being dead a half hour later they have a steroid in them that is the equivalent of heart meds and it stops their heart when they eat them also i said that maybe using the window for your main source of heat was ok i guess i should have also added to that as long as you are measuring the temp of the cage and he has an area to escape the direct heat if he needs to i just kinda thought
