very hard decission for me emotionally i have wanted a good pet for as long as i can remember and as soon as i had my own place well rented last year a got a water dragon and all the bits to go along with it to make her as happy and healthy as poss i do have everythign i need now apart from food which costs at least a week at least the unfortunate thing is which i am really struggling with is that i am constantly struggling with money always getting to my overdraft and credit limits this is every month im taking a second job and trying even harder to save more but the dragon obviously is an expense there are other things that could be done st like trying to get rid of my car on finance i really dont want to gove her up but if i had to take her to a vet or had an emergency i coulndt afford anything i really need advice im not saying she needs a vet and i would take her if i needed too im not a bad owner you have to find ways to cut edges without your beardy suffering you could start breeding your oen crickets apparenly its easy use either newspaper or playsand as bedding as both are much cheaper than reptile sand also youcould ask your local grocer if he has damaged vegs and salad not gone off but maybe brusied by transport those vegs are usually thrown away and he'll probably give them to you for either free or for a very low price you can also grow herbs such as parsly dandelion etc on your window still the saved money youcan put into a savings box in case of vet emergency's hope this helps oh and since you have a car use it only when your way is longer than a mile or if you have something yo transport walk the rest it pays off 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hamster Credit card Capitalism Public transport Divorce Tariff Monetary policy Bearded Dragon Shaggy dog story Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Drill bit Economy of the United States Insurance Craps Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Guinea pig Plastic Money Unemployment Social rule Hemp Health insurance IBM PC compatible Garfield Fancy rat Mattress Capital accumulation Hydrogen economy Ferret Student loan RuneScape skills Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Inflation Mutual fund Father's Day (Doctor Who) Veganism Dog training Supply and demand Arbitrage Bond Pet skunk Grand Theft Auto (game) Satchel Paige Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Stock Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Avenue Q RuneScape quests Hyperinflation Alaga__sia Predatory lending Gold standard Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Law of value Illegal drug trade Short selling Floppy disk Isle of Wight Urban sprawl Tooth Dairy Sin City Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Phoebe Halliwell Dog The Dalek Invasion of Earth 1957 World Series BC Rail Leasing Solar power Boston Public CPU design Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Gross domestic product Warren Buffett FairTax Atari 8-bit family Education in Germany Luck Economic rent Shen Gong Wu Equine conformation Annuity MMORPG History of the United States (1918-1945) Domestic rabbit Dandelion IPod Ayyavazhi mythology Daylight saving time Procrastination Anarchism and capitalism The Invisibles Sydney Riot of 1879 Watermelon
