african clawed frog help i had an african clawed frog for months and i loved him i couldn't figure out why his water so cloudy so i decided to do a complete water change and clean out his tank well after i put him in the tank he did three little flips and them blam dead i can't figure out what i did wrong i dechlorinated the water and also put stress coat in as well the only thing i can figure out is i didn't let the water cycle long enough to dechlorinate it or when i was scrubbing his filter with the brush i noticed it had soap on it i didn't put the soap on there so i rinsed it for about minutes to make sure the soap was completely gone can anyone help me figure out what i did wrong and why it killed him so quickly i mean he died within seconds of me putting him back in his tank the amount of chlorine from tapwater would not kill a frog they are very sensitive to strong chemicals though there are only two ways your frog could have died as quickly as what you say either a very harsh chemical was present or the water temperature was way off my best guess is you used warm water Dry cleaning Brewery Water purification Polychlorinated biphenyl EastEnders Sewage treatment Axolotl Manicure Dishwasher Sterilization (microbiology) Bong Dialysis Mattress Diseases of the honeybee Ozone depletion Textile manufacturing Sento Carbon dioxide Titanium Soap Dishwashing Days of our Lives Ozone hole Frog Water Characters in the Smurfs Dead Like Me Ozone Corrosion Menstrual cup Phoebe Halliwell Swimming pool Car washing techniques Acne Sodium hypochlorite Ammonia African clawed frog Dog 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hand washing Halitosis Aerial (dance move) Haloalkane StarCraft Episode VI Breaststroke First aid Solar variation Hard water Thermal power station Wok Solar power Drowning Poker jargon Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Air pollution Rebreather Instant coffee Pebble bed reactor Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chlorine History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Marathon (computer game) StarCraft: Uprising Whose Line Is It Anyway?
