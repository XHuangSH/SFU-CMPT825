i need to keep the temperature in my boa constrictor vivarium at degc should i use a red light bulb with thermostat or a ceramic heater with stat you can use either one as long as you have them on temp control thermostat start with a low wattage ceramic and monitor the temps to make sure the thermostat is working correctly the red light is good if you want to observe your animal at night during his dark time i actually use an undertank heater on and a light bulb on a timer hours on and hours off that i can adjust for height to raise or lower the temp to where i need it the under tank heater keeps the warm side of the tank at the right nightime temp on its own when the light kicks on it brings it up to the daytime range one side of the enclosure should be cooler than the other and you should have hides at both ends for your animal to feel secure in he will cruise back and forth during the day to regulate his body temps during the summer months i lower the bulb wattage so that it dosnt get to hot in the enclosure temp and humidity gauges are your and your snakes best friend Incandescent light bulb HVAC Thermoregulation Vacuum tube Solar power Lighting Aquarium Temperature Thermal power station Headlight Furnace Autonomous building Carburetor Mercury Atlas 6 Apollo 13 Bi-metal Arizona STS-62 Slow cooker Ceramics Fluorescent lamp Light-emitting diode Climate of the United Kingdom Houseplant Light pollution Air conditioning Heat Weather lore Hot air balloon Snake Turbocharger E85 Mars Exploration Rover Cannabis cultivation Spark plug Compact fluorescent lamp Climate of India Refrigerator Transformer Sauna Traffic light Rail terminology Spacecraft propulsion Fossil fuel power plant Heat index Coffee Light Mattress Geography of Spain Automotive lighting Ford Ranger EV Process control Mercedes-Benz A-Class Energy Urban heat island Daylight saving time Hippeastrum Mercury arc valve Nuclear fallout Glass Brewery Tank Hyperthermia Warm-blooded Sensor Siphon Ozone depletion Lake District Sea level rise Embedded system Sun Eye Electrical wiring Cruising (maritime) Heating element Day Transistor Chevrolet Corvair Guilty Gear Burglar alarm Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Laser applications Fertility awareness Trombe wall Formula One regulations Samovar Diesel engine Sleep Albedo Water heater Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Aircraft engine controls PID controller TV-FM DX BZFlag Phoenix, Arizona Thermocouple
