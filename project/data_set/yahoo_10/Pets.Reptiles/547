small skink and geacko care skinks are small australian lizards what do these animals eat what are there habitats like i don't have much experience with skinks but i had a leopard gecko they're not difficult to care for but the set up can be a little expensive they eat crickets mainly and you'll want to get special cricket food that has nutrients the gecko needs you can find it at most pet stores along with live crickets the other option is freeze dried crickets with added nutrients but they're a little more expensive fresh vegetables are never a bad idea to supplement their diet for a habitat you'll need a terrarium a fish tank will do but there are specific reptile sizes as well you'll also need some substrate for the bottom some people recommend sand or moss but i like the felt kind because it's easier to clean geckos and skinks are cold blooded so you'll need a basking light a red one is best for nocturnal reptiles and depending on the size of your terrarium possibly an under tank heater as well you want one side of the tank to be warmer than the other so he can easily regulate his body temp by moving from one side to the other about f for the hot side and to for the cooler side give or take a few degrees be sure to invest in a good thermometer your reptile will also need a place to hide a small hollow log works for this you may also want to add a branch below the basking light so he can get closer to it if he needs to warm up you'll also need a water dish and possibly a spray bottle or fogger to regulate the humidity an associate at a good pet store can show you the options for set up but be prepared to spend about to set up a basic habitat beyond the setup it's just a matter of tossing in a few crickets every other day or so and monitoring the levels of heat humidity and drinking water Hamster Thermoregulation Gecko Autonomous building Reptile Carnivorous plant Nutrition Phelsuma Japanese tea ceremony Solar power Dieting Temperature Sewage treatment Tofu Prostate cancer Vegetarianism Marine aquarium Water Organic food Houseplant Fauna of Australia Lake Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eumeces Lizard Raw food diet Bearded Dragon Cat Breastfeeding Kosher foods Earthworm Korean cuisine Guinea pig Leopard gecko Coffee Domestic rabbit American Alligator Leatherback Sea Turtle Brewery Irrigation Thermal power station Milk Dinosaur Cuisine of Denmark Fast bowling Chicken Vitamin C Carbon dioxide Pachypodium Tuatara Fugu Folic acid Bong Coconut crab Madagascar day gecko Hydroponics Colorectal cancer Dairy Cricket Alcoholic beverage Tarantula Dietary fiber Tocopherol Hiking German cuisine Chlorophyta Death Valley National Park Octopus Weather lore Cruising (maritime) Endangered species Eutrophication Pachypodium habitats Fecal incontinence Humidity Capercaillie Yosemite National Park Pea Five-lined Skink Organic farming Dog Bird Leopard Diving suit Cuisine of Brazil Goanna Hyperthermia Shrimp farm Snake Breakfast Chocolate
