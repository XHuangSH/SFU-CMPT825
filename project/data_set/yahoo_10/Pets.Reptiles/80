why did it die while molting i was caring for a hermit crab and i noticed it was molting i left it alone but when i went to change its water and food i notice it was beginning to smell a bit fishy finally after days of not standing the smell i pulled the molting shell and saw the hermit crab blackened and beginning to yeast up i can not find out why it died the way it did i'm gonna copy and paste this website i found it could be the reason i'll paste the website to for you so you can look up additional info hope this helps my learning curve for years i owned jumbo hermit crabs as pets sadly they would always die after about a year that was until the professor taught me that hermit crabs need to bury underground to survive the stress of molting often i am asked why i am drawn to hermit crabs as a pet my interest began years ago when i was in th grade and saw these fascinating and unusual creatures in a new pet shop the hermit crabs they had were of the species coenobita clypeatus commonly referred to as the purple pincher crab and they were the size of a baseball i was instantly hooked the pet shop owner was very patient and taught me how to properly handle the crabs and showed me that there wasn t any reason to be afraid of them i came home with my first pet jumbo hermit crab that i named lias since then my interest has become an obsession it s amazing to me when i think back to the early days and realize the impact this creature has had on my life for years i had jumbo crabs usually one at a time as pets at around the year mark they would always die i would be devastated and often swear off having another crab for fear of the same end result finally i would give into temptation since i loved these creatures so much each time i would try something different thinking that it was something that i was doing incorrectly the frustrating part was that i was following instructions outlined in the few hermit crab books on the market at that time during that time i was keeping my jumbo crabs on an inch or so of fish gravel in a gallon aquarium i was providing hermit crab food and a bowl of fresh water but unfortunately my jumbos would die when it was time to molt i switched to a few inches of beach sand in my cage when i moved to florida but still lost my crabs after about a year then one day something amazing happened my husband and i were sitting outside and i had my jumbo crab the professor out and was watching him roam the backyard he started digging we didn t know what he was doing so we watched eventually he completely buried himself at this point we were not quite sure what to do i brought a plastic laundry basket out to where he was buried turned it upside down over where he went down and put a cement block on top in case he tunneled back up throughout the following days i would frequently check the area where he buried to see if he had re surfaced finally after almost months of waiting i found him digging back up from his cave i picked him up and he had needle sharp nails lots of shaggy blonde sensory hair setae and his exoskeleton was shiny and new looking he had molted i was so excited i finally had a hermit crab that molted and he buried below ground to do it i decided to visit the university of miami s research library on key biscayne to see what i could find out about molting in crustaceans i learned about the dual hormones involved in the molting process and how environmental factors contribute to and determine which hormone is secreted ecdysone mh the molting hormone is secreted from the y organs located in the anterior part of the thorax mih the molt inhibiting hormone is produced in the eyestalks conditions such as darkness solitude warmth and moisture contribute to the secretion of the mh whereas unfavorable conditions such as light other crabs nearby excessive cold or heat and dryness cause the mih to be secreted in the hope that conditions will become favorable to molt this was a light bulb moment for me when a crab is able to bury underground into a protected isolated insulated environment of total darkness the molting hormone mh will be secreted and molting will commence likewise crabs that are unable to bury will experience unfavorable conditions and will secrete the mih to delay molting until conditions became favorable to bury but what happens if conditions remain unfavorable for too long my theory is that secretion of the mih is a short term means of protection if poor conditions persist the mih builds within the hermit crabs body to a toxic level and the crab reaches a point of no return the crab will not survive the molting process even if conditions finally become favorable this happens frequently to crabs kept on fish gravel in crowded conditions such as often seen in many pet shops mall kiosks and surf shops i believe that their ability to delay molting varies according to the size of the crab a jumbo can go much longer without molting than a smaller crab eventually some crabs will try to molt regardless of the conditions as with any animal the young crabs are more resilient and can often survive a surface molt i have never had a jumbo crab survive a molt attempt above ground usually they are not able to fully shed their old exoskeleton it was years ago the professor burried in the back yard i changed the way i set up my cages and i still have several of my pet crabs from that year Puberty Antarctic krill Prostate cancer New York Giants RuneScape quests Shaggy dog story American lobster Arthropod Urinary
