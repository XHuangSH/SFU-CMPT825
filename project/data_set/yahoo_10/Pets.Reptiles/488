about to get a cornsnake but have a cat good idea i have decided to get a corn snake as a pat i am aware of how to look after them and have friends with reptiles and snakes but wanted to know if there would be issues of haveing a cart and snake in the same house obviously when handling the snake i would put the cat in another room but i was wondering is it a bad idea will the cats presence aggrevate the snake or vice verser i had three cats kingsnakes one dog dozens of frogs a crested gecko a cockatoo two tarantulas a hamster and a rabbit all at the same time most animals won't be too agressive with each other if you give them some time to adjust but a snake is kept in it's cage mostly anyway if you take it out just watch how the cat is and decide whether you just need to be careful when taking the snake out they sell plenty of things to secure the top of a cage if you're really worried but a nice big heavy rock or some books work if you're that concerned or don't want to have to purchase the clips all of my cats left everything alone they actually loved the dog and bird actually and the snake probably won't care well that's pretty much it like i said i never had a problem Hamster Shaggy dog story Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ferret The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Meta-reference The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Theory of conduct Fauna of Australia Cat Fancy rat Garfield Humphrey Bogart 2000 Australian Grand Prix Timon and Pumbaa Taikyoku shogi Ranma __ characters Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Chinese astrology Reptile Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Saga (band) Spidey Super Stories EastEnders Philip J.
