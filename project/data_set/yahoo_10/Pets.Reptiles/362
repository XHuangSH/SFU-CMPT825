should i get a second mouse my boyfriend's sister gave us a mouse as a pet which was supposed to fed to her snake the mouse is very sweet and loves to be held but i read that mice are social creatures and should be kept in pairs or groups the problem is that our mouse is male and we were told that you shouldn't keep two non littermate males in the same cage but we don't want babies so getting a female is out of the question i just want the little guy to be happy would it be best to keep him as an only mouse and just make sure he gets a lot of attention get a second male mouse and just hope they get along get a different species of critter like a female dwarf hamster so they can be social but not have babies suggestions would be appreciated thanks where can i get my mouse fixed do regular vets do it is it expensive i have a pet mouse and he is an only mouse and is perfectly happy just so long as you give him lots of love and attention as other answerers have said make sure he has lots of activities in his cage an empty toilet roll tube works wonders and also handle him atleast every other day or every day if possible he's used to being on his own now and is so glad he didn't end up as snake food man i hate that feeding live mice to a snake i know it would happen in the wild but if the snake is domesticated as far as you can domesticate a snake you should feed it freeze dried mice if they have died of natural causes if they are killed just to feed the snake then that is wrong also when my little lucky dies he will be buried in my moms garden along side all my fish that are buried there too i'm so attached to the cute little mouse but have accepted that when he starts to suffer with his tumor the kindest thing to do is to take him to be euthanised i'm going giving him a bath now don't think he'll like it much though but he does enjoy being dried by my hairdryer later Hamster Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield Ferret Fancy rat RuneScape quests Trapping Guinea pig Phoebe Buffay's songs House Mouse Chicken Theory of conduct Felis sapiens EastEnders The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Futurama (TV series - season 2) Elephant Spidey Super Stories Domestic rabbit Livestock Little Britain FoxTrot Pok__mon Live!
