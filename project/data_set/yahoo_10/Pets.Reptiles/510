information on frogs i want to get a water frog and a turtle with some snails and mabye some guppies would they be ok to live together and i want some information on water frogs water tutles small golden snails and guppies what do they all eat and are they hard to take care thnx the turtles will eat the frogs the snails and the guppy's red eared sliders are the most popular form of aquatic turtle they should have a half filled aquarium with at least a third of the tank devoted to a 'drying out' area set above the water but easily accessible these are usually made of simulated wood stacked to be above the water the tank should be at least a gallon for one turtle but a gallon tank is an excellent choice you can use gravel to line the bottom of the tank if you want to but it should be large enough so it won't fit in the turtle's mouth you'll need a heating lamp usually sold for snakes to set above the basking spot and another full spectrum reptile uva uvb should be provided this full spectrum light is necessary for proper calcium metabolism the only snail i would introduce to a turtle tank would be 'pest' snails pond snails and malaysian burrowing snails called trumpet snails as both breed asexually and will reproduce a lot of snails in very little time your turtle will have a snack and they won't get out of control you can probably get both types of snails free from any pet store that has an aquatics section as they are pests and no one really wants them in a fish tank tank sizes a rule of thumb is the water should be twice as deep as your turtle is long a inch turtle will need inches of water a inch turtle the max size for a red ear will need a whopping inches of water with enough room above the water to provide a suitable basking spot and to ensure the turtle won't get out for what red ears eat see here http exoticpets about com od aquaticturtles f feedingturtles htm the length of the tank should be long enough to provide enough swimming space which should be or times as long as your turtle is a inch turtle will need inches of swimming space and a big enough basking spot in addition to this the tank will also require a heater to keep the temperature at degrees a filter to keep the water reasonably clean both of which have to be protected from the turtle's curiosity frogs are a little bit easier to care for and won't harm guppy's that are too big to fit in their mouth aquatic frogs require a setup exactly as a fish aquarium a suitable tank size heater filter and substrate small aquarium gravel live or plastic plants can be used and there should be a feeding dish sunken into the substrate enough that the lip of the dish is level with the substrate african dwarf frogs are the most common aquatic frog kept and they are relatively easy to care for they require a well cycled tank some special feeding and a few hiding spots and they're happy adf's skin is sensitive hence the requiring of an established tank they hunt by motion snapping at anything that moves nearby them so people most often thaw frozen food like bloodworms and mix them with some tank water then suck them into a turkey baster and squirt it into the submerged dish you might also try taking some tweezers and wiggling some cleaned earthworm pieces in front of them the frogs will live peacefully with the snails but the guppies might eat the frogs' food before the frogs can get to it the only aquatic snail i would recommend to keep with your frogs are the snails sold as 'mystery snails' which require one of each gender to reproduce and when they do their eggs are easy to spot and get rid of some pet stores actually buy adult specimens if you do end up with a breeding pair and happen to get more the variety 'golden inca snail' actually grows quite large from golf ball to baseball size but they're a very nice yellow gold red eared slider information http exoticpets about com cs reptilesturtles a reslidercare htm adf information http
