my turtle won't bask he is an african sideneck who hardly ever comes out of the water he has a cool brick and enough land leading up to it he seems to only like to be below the filter water falling down on him help he has a uv light and a basking lamp i used to keep african sidenecks and they never basked this is common not only with bottom dwelling but shallow water turtles as well there are two reasons turtles bask one is to regulate body temperature and the other is to help with the digestive process in shallow water many species get plenty of heat even while in the water the fact that african sidenecks are considered bottom dwellers as well as the fact that most pet turtles are kept in shallow water enclosures could answer your question many people come on here asking why their sliders painted and other 'basking' turtles won't bask this is the most common reason too hot one thing to keep in mind is that captive turtles cannot escape the heat while wild turtles can dive down to cooler temps if your uv and basking lights have thermostats which they should turn them down a notch experiment with temperature regulation and watch you turtle's behavior chances are he is fine most bottom dwellers only need to bask when the water temp gets too low i kept my 'non basking' sidenecks for years and they never had any health problems i read your question again he seems to only like to be below the filter water falling down on him help i would say that's a definite sign of an over heated enclosure Thermoregulation Temperature Brewery Snapping turtle Thermostat Leatherback Sea Turtle Coffee Basking Shark Water Aquarium Furnace Fluorescent lamp Thermal power station Incandescent light bulb Hyperthermia Swimming Dog Sewage treatment Turtle Shrimp farm Hibernation Heat Water (molecule) Autonomous building Eutrophication Transformer Desert Behavioral ecology Sauna Orca Logo programming language Homeostasis Refrigerator Air conditioning Enceladus (moon) Warm-blooded Carburetor Dialysis Hamster Lighting Species Plesiosaur HVAC Solar power Espresso Volcano Renewable energy Entropy Pebble bed reactor Hard disk Plastic Nuclear fusion Mercury (element) Nuclear reactor Thermodynamics Cat Urban heat island Motor oil Fossil fuel power plant Sento Permian-Triassic extinction event Glass Spark plug Climate of the United Kingdom Microwave oven Fish farming Green Sea Turtle Opportunity rover Carnivorous plant Apollo 13 Soul Nuclear power Ecology of Hong Kong Antarctic krill Atmospheric circulation Lake Color temperature Peltier-Seebeck effect Polyethylene terephthalate Ozone depletion Many-worlds interpretation Flood geology Color Water purification Biology Sea turtle Huygens probe Bottlenose Dolphin Bong Fire fighting Deep lake water cooling Ironing Fishing
