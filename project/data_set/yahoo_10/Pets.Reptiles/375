any lizard owners i just got an anole lizard and i know the basics of caring for them but any tips or any special needs i also need a name for a girl lizard lol thanks i have a juvenile beardie too young foe me to determine the gender but i have a feeling it's a boy i named him bert just cause i think it was a funny name for a lizard if i had a girl delilah and fluffy would definitely be in contention just because they make me laugh d someone's already mentioned it but they love climbing things i have those fake plants in my viv they have a suction cap on one end and you can stick them to the glass it allows him to get closer to the heat source without being too close when he wants to in the morning i give my plants a mist of water so they form droplets it's just another way of encouraging them to drink good luck with your girl d Good Morning, Vietnam Pure Pwnage Lizard The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pitaten Bong Opportunity rover Electrophysiology Care Bears Humphrey Bogart Water The Doors About a Boy Friends White phosphorus incendiary Garfield AFI 100 Years series The Smiths Polychrotidae Buffy the Vampire Slayer B3ta Holes (book) Ron and Fez McFly Characters in the Smurfs Spanish nouns Water (molecule) Glossary of firefighting equipment Honey Oh My Goddess!
