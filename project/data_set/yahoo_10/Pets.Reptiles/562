res turtle mating with snail so my turtle isn't inches in shell length and it is extremely tiny i thought that i wouldn't know the sex until it grew long nails and all the other stuff a turtle develops when you can determine the sex no need to go into all that but i saw my turtle doing the male mating ritual where they stretch their arms out and vibrate their little hands and then he proceeded to get on top of the snail which i placed in his tank for his protein he's not even as big as my palm yet so is it normal for a turtle at such a young age to do the mating ritual and why is he trying to mate with his food the snail is he masturbating oh yes he did try and eat it earlier today and now it won't come out of it's shell so maybe he's just trying to sweet vibe her out of her shell it might be challenging it to a fight Snail Leatherback Sea Turtle American lobster Puberty Violin Slug Coconut crab Spider Yerba mate Masturbation Common bean Animal American Alligator Sea turtle Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Hamster Franklin (television series) Mountain Gorilla Sexual differentiation Hair Chicken Sexual intercourse Maize The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sexual attraction Tank Platypus Fishing Drosophila melanogaster Cat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Shark Tetrapod Discworld (world) Turtle Koopa Troopa Ammunition Rock, Paper, Scissors Earthworm Piccolo Junior Saga Blanding's Turtle Red Squirrel Kodocha SpongeBob SquarePants Sex-determination system Sexual reproduction Tuatara Sake Sea-Monkey Strap-on dildo Timpani Tarantula Penis Ecological selection Human sexual behavior Pittwater Council Ta__no Great A'Tuin Egg (food) Food Oral sex Gastropoda April O'Neil Elephant Nile crocodile Octopus Shredder (TMNT) Fauna of Australia Bird Old wives' tale GunBound Pop Will Eat Itself Clownfish Ayyavazhi mythology Child sexuality Snapping turtle Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze One Piece minor characters Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour Human penis size Cannibalism Beetle Japanese tea ceremony Prostate cancer Caterpillar Shotgun Peanut Anal sex Counter-Strike Tenshinhan Dinosaur Blood (computer game) Tank classification Gesture Screw Combine (Half-Life 2) Textile manufacturing Marine aquarium Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Gender
