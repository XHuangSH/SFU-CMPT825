just got a baby crested gecko i was wondering what a good play area that i can make for them would be i guess a lot of stuff to climb on i have to make it in some sort of container so that my cats dont eat it any suggestions first of all dont insult me i have everything it needs in its cage my question was what would be a cage suggestion for a play area you dont want to give a lil baby a big area to jump around in and hurt itself but a bigger area to play in i am not a weeks fun pet owner sorry grow up and dont insult those you do not know the situation i just asked for a play area suggestion where my cats cant eat it or attempt to eat it apparently you dont know that crested geckos dont need heat they live off of baby food fruit and crickets and repcal apparently you didnt do your research and a gallon tank the thing is only an inch long poor baby would die before it found its food also it has its own living tank i just wanted something a bit bigger for it to play in but i am no sure if a reptarium would be too big at its age fyi my cats dont even know the creature is in the house its in a closed room where they arent allowed to go hi looks like you're trying to make the best possible home for your little one you'll want either a the x x exo terra tank or a gallon long tank flipped upward so it's tall for your little one when he's full grown for now a gallon should be perfect i give mine a big stick with several off shooting branches silk plant vines or standing plants you can also do live plants but you'll need a little full spectrum lighting for that otherwise you can keep it pretty simple for now so you can keep an eye on him i also use repti hammocks for some of mine and they seem to love them you can also look into getting a ledge http www pangeareptile com products htm cupholders you can hang these up on the side to get the food off the ground or get the stand for them i'd also suggest joining a reptile forum if you've got any other questions you can chat with other crested gecko owners and get suggestions from them and catch the bug they're addicting Hamster RuneScape quests Fancy rat Garfield Opportunity rover Guinea pig Cat Mario Japanese tea ceremony Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Skateboarding trick Pitaten Paintball Marine aquarium Slayers Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Xiaolin Showdown The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Kodocha One Piece minor characters Shen Gong Wu Cannabis cultivation Domestic rabbit Professional wrestling attacks Ferret The Legend of Zelda series enemies Pet skunk Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Hip hop rivalries Have I Got News For You Tung Chung Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blood on the Tracks Jam (TV series) Vegeta GunZ The Duel Little Britain Aerial (dance move) Goldfish Milton H.
