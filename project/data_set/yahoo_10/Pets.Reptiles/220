do chinese water dragons sleep underwater or breathe underwater my chinese water dragon keeps on going into the water and there are big rocks in the water it gets in between the rocks and justs lays there then i put it back on its sleeping platform thing a log with a flat top but it gets back into the water and moves around really fast like it is drowning the water is inches deep the dragon is about months old and it is inches long not including the tail mine is about or months old and from tip to tail he's probably somewhere between a foot and a half to two feet long but mine seems to hate the darn water sometimes he'll sit on the edge of his tub so just his tail is in there but if we put him in all he does is climb out as soon as possible i still have no idea what the heck temperature the water should be at someone needs to put that to an exact degree this whole pee warm lukewarm' bussiness is useless there's huge differences between what i might think is lukewarm and what my boyfriend thinks anyways as we don't have a heater we assume that the water will become room temperature after a while anyways but our guy won't ever get in the water wich is bad cause he has massive problems shedding but yeah how do you trian yours to actually acknoledge the water' part of their names Diving Sonic the Hedgehog Dragon boat Mattress Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling holds Textile manufacturing Shen Gong Wu Submarine Opportunity rover Scuba set Decompression sickness Water (molecule) Customs and etiquette of Japan Sauna Drowning Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) B-47 Stratojet Vegeta Swimming Toilet humour Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Minor Harry Potter Beasts Swingout Backstroke Breath of Fire III Torpedo Yosemite Valley Donkey Kong 64 Death Valley National Park Unreal Underwater Childbirth Hip hop collaborations The Death Gate Cycle Whitewater Mathematician Steven Wright Nile crocodile Frogman Conker's Bad Fur Day P-38 Lightning Refrigerator Rocky Mountains Swimming pool Dialysis RuneScape quests Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Huangshan Mountains Knife Rebreather Glossary of climbing terms Little Britain Scuba diving Second Battle of the Atlantic Snorkel The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Entropy Xenomorph Diving suit Ecco the Dolphin Professional wrestling throws Spirit rover Friends Dog Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Temperature Atmospheric pressure Horse Naval mine Vacuum Piccolo Junior Saga Breaststroke Iowa class battleship Fast bowling Phoebe Halliwell Jon Secada Dobermann Suplex Cruising (maritime) Liquid breathing Professional wrestling aerial techniques Eddie Guerrero Water Climate of the United Kingdom She Loves You Nine Inch Nails MMORPG Chinese character First Battle of the Atlantic Hamster Hot air balloon Campfire Glacier Basement
