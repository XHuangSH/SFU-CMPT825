how much space do red eared sliders res need i hav female res and hav no clue of how much space they need someone plz answer cause my turtles r currently cramped up in a tiny fish tank and theyd be happy if yu answer thanks if yu answer red eared sliders females get about the size of a dinner plate when full grown they are like many fish and reptiles they will only grow as big as their tank allows once you put them in a larger one they grow more we had a slider for years in a gallon and she finally passed from old age good filtration for a turtle really doesn't exist they have a lot of poo which they do eat and it is so much a filter really can't effectively work so a weekly cleaning is the best with a filter heating isn't really necessary either if you home is degrees that's just fine also they enjoy a little cooler temps in the winter to mimic their hibernation you will notice they are healthier and grow better when the cooler temps let them rest also in the cooler temps you will notice a drop in eating finally a reptile bulb that mimics sunlight is a must if you get the incandescent kind they will use that a a heat source and love sprawling out under it if it is a bulb system leave the bulb out of one side so they don't get too hot and put a resting place out of the water under the bulb Brewery Temperature Aquarium Light-emitting diode Stage lighting Marine aquarium Incandescent light bulb Sewage treatment Air conditioning Fluorescent lamp Thermoregulation Leatherback Sea Turtle Sun Diode Autonomous building Reptile Solar power Carburetor Hamster Traffic light Hippeastrum Lighting Reef tank Tuatara Houseplant Vacuum tube Color temperature Tetrapod Dichroic filter Dishwasher Sliders Kitchen Biodiesel Yerba mate Dry cleaning Solar system Water purification Opportunity rover Gray Wolf Urban sprawl Beatmania IIDX Coffee Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Sly Cooper Fossil fuel power plant Environmental concerns with electricity generation Humphrey Bogart Cannabis cultivation Rocko's Modern Life Urban heat island Glass Light Customs and etiquette of Japan Hydrogen economy Electrophysiology Billboard Hot 100 Sea-Monkey Bicycle lighting Agar plate Headlight Loudspeaker Warm-blooded Mercury Atlas 6 Sunlight Creatures in Bionicle Crookes radiometer Water Solar panel Dinosaur Mnemonic Home repair Swamp cooler Extraterrestrial skies Ultraviolet Photometry (optics) E85 Renewable energy Railway signal Stereoscopy Polarization Platypus Shit Kidney Dead Sea GunBound Dialysis Radio Yerevan Discus (fish) Theory of conduct Light pollution Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Vacuum Leaf Japanese tea ceremony Animal Jumpstart 3rd Grade American Black Bear
