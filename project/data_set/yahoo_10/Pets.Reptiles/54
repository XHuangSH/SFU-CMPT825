ball python shedding problemo i work in a pet store and am relatively well traversed in reptile care nonetheless my ball python who is approx feet long is having some shedding problems i dont have a humidity monitor in my cage i have a heating mat under the cage hide box above it and a lamp on the opposite end a bowl full of water and some wood shrubbery purchased from my store my girl's eyes turned blue probably about days ago dissipated about a day and a half ago she's having an incomplete shed so i proceded to soak her for a half hour in luke warm water and now only the bottom half of her is shedding i am going to monitor the humidity starting tomorrow when i go to work and buy the necessary monitor i have a spray bottle of which i have sprayed the substrate with and i monitor the temp so i assumed the humidity was ok i am really worried about her bc i love my snake and i want her to be as healthy as possible what did i do wrong that resulted in an incomplete shed what needs to be done when a snake has problems shedding it is almost always a humidity problem ball pythons need at least humidity that can be hard to maintain in some areas so you'll definitely want to get a humidity monitor also there is a problem with the heating sources you have in the cage you say that you have an undertank heat mat on one side of the cage and a heat lamp on the other that means that you aren't providing a proper temperature gradient for your ball python one side of the cage needs to be cool and the other should be warm you don't want both sides of the cage to be warm unless you have your snake in a gallon aquarium remove the undertank heater if you can't keep a basking spot in the warm area at degrees then put the undertank heater on the same side as the heat lamp most likely the shedding problem is due to the humidity being too low but the heat sources could be contributing to the problem you may need to help your snake shed this time if the eyecaps don't come off on their own and you've never manually shed eye caps get a reptile vet or a reptile rescue worker to show you how Thermal power station Reptile Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Dairy Refrigerator Aquarium Sun Solar power Hamster Autonomous building Cannabis cultivation Thermoregulation HVAC Marine aquarium Sauna Mercury Atlas 6 Diesel engine Houseplant Mattress Vacuum tube Shaggy dog story Nuclear power Guinea pig Water Diseases of the honeybee Textile manufacturing Dialysis Chicken Cold fusion Global climate model Solar variation Hyperthermia Coffee Incandescent light bulb Dog Air conditioning RuneScape quests Thermostat Carbon dioxide Caving Rail terminology Aerial (dance move) Las Vegas metropolitan area Milk Dundas Square Printed circuit board Hypothermia Avalanche Torpedo Brewery Surveillance Ozone depletion Renewable energy Bearded Dragon Drill bit Climate of the United Kingdom Fossil fuel power plant Heat Fire extinguisher Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Hydroponics Hiking Warm-blooded STS-62 Mars Exploration Rover Effects of global warming Japanese tea ceremony Salt Lake City, Utah Ozone hole Pet skunk The Day After Tomorrow Plasma (physics) Crocodilia Bicycle lighting Burmese python Seismic retrofit Energy development Escape from New York Temperature Plastic Hydrogen economy Wind Common cold Dallas, Texas Wind power Garter snake
