could a texas horned lizard a flying gecko and an armadillo lizard live together in the same cage all three of the lizards are the same size so i was wondering if i got the three of them if they could live together ohhhh boy you making all the wrong decisions i don't know where to start my primary area of research husbandry is with phrynosoma horned lizards and the picture on my avatar is of a texas horned lizard i am a member of the horned lizard conservation society and run a reptile rescue first the texas horned lizard is protected in every state where it is native except az but az still requires a hunting permit it is unlawful to possess transport buy or sell a texas horned lizard without permit only thls legally obtained from az or legally captive bred through commercial propagation permits can be bought or sold to the public and not many people actually have those permits or can prove the legal origin of the lizard i suggest you check that out before buying as it is more likely than not that any thl you find on the market is on the market illegally next the texas horned lizard or any other horned lizard does not make a good pet for anyone without experience and by that i mean a lot of experience i have years of herp experience of the recognized species in north america the thl is one of the hardest to keep alive in captivity they are highly prone to stress and this will kill them without a proper habitat and other conditions such as diet being properly met it sounds like you haven't done enough research to have such as proper habitat and don't have the experience horned lizards also primarily eat harvester ants as a large percentage of their diet they are obligate ant eaters in the wild and need harvester ants to be healthy there are too many biological reasons for this that i won't go into detail here but it suffices to say that you will have to mail order large quantities of harvester ants in order to feed a horned lizard typically they run about per ants and the typical hl can eat ants in one week so think about that there is a reason that not many people have horned lizards and that they are pretty much left to the experts and those with money that's because they are expensive to feed and they have very high mortality rates in captivity more than of all horned lizards taken into captivity will die in inexperienced hands they are closing in on the brink of extinction and i would prefer if you left this genus of lizard to the experts to be honest first general rule of reptile keeping is that you don't keep different species or different genus for god's sake together without a good deal of experience an outdoor habitat and being damn sure they are compatable and certified healthy and free of parasites the lizards you are talking about keeping together don't even live in the same parts of the world together jeez the armadillo and thl have similar climate preferences but are from different continents the flying gecko is from jungle habitat and could never live in the climates the other prefers all of these lizards would highly stress if you placed them together the armadillo and thl are very shy and will always be scared of one another the armadillo will stay curled up in a ball and the thl will probably be constantly climbing the walls trying to get out and eventually break it's tail the gecko would be running around stressing and somebody would end up getting a respiratory infection either from too little or too much humidity please until you get some real experience try sticking to an easy species one species and just one of that species leopard and some other geckos make good herps for beginners as well as anoles or a cornsnake i guarantee you based on your question i have confiscated horned lizards from people who had more experience than you do that's just the facts sorry but i have to say it because i care about herps and i'm a conservationist and rescuer my pages http freewebs
