does anyone know where to release pet turtles i want to release them to somewhere that they would be good the turtles sizes are bigger than my hand average size hand there are five of them if there are parks where you live let them go there split them up if possible it's better for them that's what happens when people sell baby red eared sliders buyers don't know what they're getting into i had two at one time and they were getting to be too much trouble to care for they got to be about or long before i let them go i enjoyed having them but changing the water and cleaning the tank was very inconvenient for me i bought all the equipment i needed to care for them though heaters light filters thermometers special foods etc that's better treatment than a lot of those poor turtles get next time i'm definitely going to look for a tortoise good night i just thought about it after reading the next answer but it is possible for turtles in captivity to transmit diseases to wild turtles typically it's a bad idea to let pets go they might become an invasive species but red eared sliders are all over the place so that's pretty unlikely if you can't find someone who will take them off your hands letting them go in a park is about the best option you have good luck gee three thumbs down the answer isn't that bad what was i supposed to tell her to do kill the turtles if she can't find someone who wants to take them because if you can't let them go in a place where they're native or find someone to take them off your hands then that's about all you can do anyway those ponds in parks are hardly natural ecosystems and they usually have red eared sliders anyway i'm making an assumption that those turtles are red eared sliders because that's the most common species for people to get stuck with involuntarily because of all those people selling their hatchlings for educational purposes Reptile Social rule Discus (fish) Turtle Snapping turtle Theory of conduct Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Hamster Leatherback Sea Turtle Gal__pagos Islands Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Poker jargon Aquarium Sliders Violin Kylie Minogue Tetrapod Species Hard disk Fish farming Supply and demand Goldfish Ecology Neopets Cat Sea turtle Dog 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hedgehog Microeconomics Tuatara Sewage treatment Mid-levels Light pollution Domestic rabbit Bee Gees Island Fox Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Labrador Retriever Cruising (maritime) Cheetah Rocko's Modern Life Pet Knife EastEnders Nicomachean Ethics Escherichia coli O157:H7 Endangered species GunBound Brewery Beaches of Hong Kong Dairy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Marine aquarium Tiger Sin City Common cold About a Boy Futurama (TV series - season 5) Autonomous building Mosquito Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
