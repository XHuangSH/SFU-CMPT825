how can i get the humidity up in my chinese water dragon tank i need to be between how can i get it up to there now its like it needs to get higher humidity humidity should be about even with a water container in the cage this can be difficult to maintain i have live pothos and dracenae plants in my cage planted in soil so watering and misting these plants also helps to provide a humid atmosphere you should get a gage that measures the humidity try to mist the enclosure twice a day if you are really having problems keeping the humidity above or higher try covering part of the top of the enclosure if it has a screen cover you could put a piece of plexiglass or even saran wrap or foil over part of the opening this should help a bit but by all means never cover the whole top of the enclosure there must always be air circulating in the cage some people feel that maintaining a humid environment is not necessary i do not feel this way water dragons are from a tropical humid climate and being kept in the harsh warm dry conditions of captivity can be harmful to your dragons health iguana's also come from tropical humid areas and it has been found that if they are kept in captivity in a too dry enclosure they will more easily become dehydrated once an iguana becomes dehydrated the kidneys start to become affected many iguana's die every year from kidney failure some of these deaths are the result of animal protein in their diet and some of these deaths are caused by chronic dehydration while iguana's and water dragons come from different areas of the world i feel that their habitat and living environment are very similar please mist your cages once or twice a day and make every effort to maintain a proper humidity level for your dragons sake his life span could be affected as a result of low humidity levels http www triciaswaterdragon com Hamster Aquarium Carnivorous plant Humidity Global warming and agriculture Fancy rat Kidney Hiking Diabetes mellitus Dialysis Climate of the United Kingdom Dehydration Hydroponics Gal__pagos Islands Tropical cyclone Carbon dioxide National Weather Service Weight training Global climate model Solar power Cannabis cultivation Sauna Ecology of Hong Kong El Ni__o Geography of Spain Effects of global warming Solar variation Water vapor Florida Keys Wind power Biome Air conditioning Asthma Deforestation Energy development Prostate cancer Livestock Carburetor K__ppen climate classification Dam Air pollution Survival skills Sea level rise Vegetation Ionizing radiation Bonsai Biodiversity Sewage treatment Hypoglycemia Glycogen storage disease type I Loudspeaker Thermal power station Desert Ice core Climate change Severe weather terminology (United States) Seismic retrofit Mosquito Biology Geography of Bolivia Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Marine aquarium Gout Vegetarianism Nutrition Coral reef Geography of Mexico Geography of Brazil Jute Guinea pig Genetically modified food Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests The Day After Tomorrow Equine conformation Legionellosis Nuclear power Environmental concerns with electricity generation Hard disk Atkins Nutritional Approach Meteorology Stoma Lake Terraforming Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Global warming Mattress Cancer Capercaillie Pachypodium habitats Atlanta metropolitan area
