what is better bedding for iguanas sand or mulch i've been buying this mulch or bark stuff as bedding for my iguana cage but i was wondering if buying sand would be better with the sand i thought it might keep him warmer and be softer but the bark might soak up his mess better any suggestions don't use anything that the iguana can accidentally ingest we use white towels and or newspaper for all of our iguanas if the iguana accidentally ingest something he can get impacted which can cause death please reconsider your substrate choice Sewage treatment Chinchilla FoxTrot Hamster Shit Honey fungus Mulch SpongeBob SquarePants The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Gypsy moth Towel Iguana Stratification (botany) Opportunity rover Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Black pepper The Voyage of the Beagle LSD Pachypodium habitats Traumatic brain injury Earthworm Tennessee Williams Mattress Dinosaur Paracetamol Plutonium Fallout (computer game) Selma's Choice Jayne Mansfield Cinnamon Dye Weed control Sand Iron Fist Aida (musical) Johnny Depp The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Academy Award for Costume Design Paul Is Dead Iron Toilet paper Origin of life Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Academy Award for Best Art Direction Eisner Award Paleoclimatology Sugar Camp Delta Wood pulp Shark Seabird Pansy Eucalyptus Mars Shaggy dog story Straw Rich Mullins Geology of the British Isles Kurt Cobain Don Rosa Leather Bladderwort Alcoy, Cebu Habitats of Pachypodium of Southern Continental Africa and Madagascar Dune Collecting fossils Russian joke Oak Albatross Canyonlands National Park Upholstery Gas mantle White Sands National Monument Pebble bed reactor Lightning Felis sapiens True Crime: Streets of LA Ripped Pants Daylight saving time Sudden Oak Death Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Sam Kinison Calvin and Hobbes Manicure Mixed martial arts Road traffic accident Advertising Inception of Darwin's theory Tuatara Brugmansia Blood on the Tracks Minor characters in Seinfeld Knots Landing Hydrogen peroxide Scarlet's Walk Fermi paradox Dead Like Me Hide (musician) 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake
