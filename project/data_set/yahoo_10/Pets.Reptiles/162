how do snakes act when they are shedding i have a ball python and i have never seen it shed before how do they usually act i was told that their bellies will turn pink before they shed my snakes belly is pinkish and he is acting really weird someone suggested to be that he may be shedding last night he was fine and now today he is barely moving and is unresponsive but is still alive he actually seems like he's drunk with the way he is moving his head i can not find a vet that will take me for an emergency appointment yet or an animal hospital that specializes in snakes around here any advice until i can get to the vet their bellies do in fact turn pinkish in color before a shed also look at his eyes and if they are creamy colored or milky then this is a true sign of a shed snakes can get inactive due to shed meaning that they will usually stay in their hide boxes if you have one until the skin starts to peel it is a good idea to have something such as a rock not a heated rock that the snake can rub against to help the shedding process it is a good idea not to try and hold the snake until after the shedding process is complete due to the fact that the snake may strike you the shedding process usually takes about days make sure that there is appropriate humidity in the tank and plenty of fresh water in his soaking drinking dish because he will spend most of his time soaking Snake Dairy First aid Chicken Hyperthermia Leather Meriones unguiculatus Big Boss Reptile Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Garfield Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ninja Scroll Tanning Animal communication Tofu Cantonese cuisine Thermoregulation Bacon The Dalek Invasion of Earth Fugu Textile manufacturing The Shining (film) Cat Astronomy on Mars Sin City Cocoa Tuatara Leaf Snake charming President of Ireland Cobra Commander Apple Happy Tree Friends Human skin color Poker jargon Social rule Thermal power station Crocodilia Escape from New York Wool Pet skunk Opportunity rover Creationism Pok__mon Abilities Potato Molotov cocktail The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Solid Snake Chocolate Solar power Herpes simplex virus Clown Plame affair Drowning Metal Gear The Legend of Zelda series enemies Common bean Richard Chase Sake Cigar Tattoo Sea serpent Kaa Rum Pysanka Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Alcoholics Anonymous Garter snake The Parting of the Ways Aerial (dance move) The Contender (television series) Hiking Infant baptism Bong Chinese White Dolphin Moult Pottery Conan the Barbarian Kosher foods Tai shogi RuneScape quests Jute Housebreaking Anaconda The Subtle Knife The Star Wars Holiday Special General relativity Drill bit New York Giants European dragon Pitaten Extraterrestrial skies Fancy rat Water (molecule)
