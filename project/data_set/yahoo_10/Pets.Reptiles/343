water dragon laid a turd i can't tell i came home and found this thing floating in his water tub it's purple and oblong and it really looks like the shape of an egg but it's purple aparently he laid one last night but my boyfriend threw it out cause he assummed it was a turd i know that water dragons lay about or so eggs at once but i dunno my baby is a virgin and about months old or so so maybe he just doesn't know what to do with eggs he does have substrate in with him one of those bricks that turn into pulp when you soak it in water so if it is a clutch i thought that he'd bury it i really thought it was a he if it is an egg then well i guess it's bad cause it's purple and eggs are supposed to be white if it'sa turd then hopefully that don't mean he's constipated or impacted what do you think is it cause for concern i'm worried about egg binding or impaction or all sorts of potential bads well i dunno i was worried it's a huge turd that don't at all look like his previous turds so i was worried and well i'm pretty sure there's been a time or two in your life that you've been constipated and you're not dead it just means your poo gets bigger and fatter and harder and is hard to squeeze out is impaction a dead or not impacted thing i assummed there could be like a partial blockage before official death or something how cool would it be if this thing hatched i could have a poo baby haha it's waste make sure to disinfect the water bowl Egg (food) Toilet humour Shit Conker's Bad Fur Day Feces Theory of conduct Egg (biology) Kyle Broflovski Piccolo Junior Saga Pysanka Sewage treatment Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Chicken Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wood pulp The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Social rule Seabird Professional wrestling holds EastEnders Leatherback Sea Turtle American lobster Yoshi Humphrey Bogart Joke Frog Dead Like Me Russian joke The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Friends Poker jargon Shen Gong Wu Jennifer Lopez Philosophical skepticism Samuel Goldwyn Freddy Fender One Tree Hill (TV series) Alaga__sia Mario series enemies Diving Platypus Menstrual cup The Death Gate Cycle Water The Lovely Bones Shaggy dog story Shark The chicken or the egg Sonic the Hedgehog The Ashlee Simpson Show Breastfeeding Incarnations of Immortality Urinary incontinence Avenue Q Breath of Fire III Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Swimming pool King Piccolo Saga Kenny McCormick Ocean's Twelve Minor Harry Potter Beasts Weebl and Bob Mark Calaway Max Martin AFI 100 Years series Emu Doug Sonic Adventure The Book of Five Rings Garfield Mancow Static Shock Red Ribbon Army Naruto jutsu Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Discworld gods Origin belief Meat Loaf Beetle Albatross Hip hop collaborations GunBound Eric Cartman Negima Glen Jacobs Valles Marineris Queen bee Tenshinhan Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Boom Town (Doctor Who) Paul Is Dead Phoebe Halliwell Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Bubble Bobble Megan Griffin Romulus and Remus Jon Secada
