need specialists view about my leopard gecko i have a leopard gecko about mnths old shes not growing and has rubber front legs the doctor just thinks its a disease and as long as she hunts shes ok but thats not my issue i want to get another one thats normal that will get big is it ok if i get another one and put it in the same cage or will there be territorial issues or nething like that and yes we know she has calicium deficiency we do powder her crickets syringe feed her calcium and feed her baby food green beans if it's simply calcium deficiency you may be able to get away with adding another they are social to an extent and more likely to be social if being introduced into the habitat at the same time you run the risk of exposing a new one to any disease though if it's more than just a calcium problem best bet is to keep them separated especially for the safety of your first gecko those rubbery legs can be a problem for efficient hunting when there is competition around getting back to the calcium thing do you have a uv light on the tank as well as a heat source a lot of times the uv is overlooked and deemed unneccessary when they are compeltely necessary to help metabolize calcium if you can get a good uv light and make sure there's no clear plastic between the bulb and the screen or habitat top any extra resistance to the light beams makes it harder for them to be effective when they reach the gecko Cheese Milk Nutrition Anorexia nervosa Tank Coeliac disease Dairy Rickets Vitamin D Folic acid Welding Carbon dioxide Mesothelioma Light-emitting diode Equine conformation Gecko Calcium Bicycle lighting Vegetarianism Growth hormone treatment Food Veganism Coffee Hypoglycemia Fluorescent lamp Long-term potentiation Fast bowling Thermal power station Prostate cancer Intellectual property Internal ballistics Domestic rabbit Swimming Color Headlight Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Phelsuma Plastic Poker jargon Organic farming Carnivorous plant Incandescent light bulb Krag-J__rgensen Tocopherol Psoriasis Livestock Firearm Seismic retrofit Laser Stage lighting Soybean Softball Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Glass Diving suit Hunting Ultraviolet Dieting Alcohol fuel Cat Guinea pig Elephant E85 Laws of cricket Genetically modified food Microeconomics Casting Diseases of the honeybee Ecology Diabetes mellitus Solar cell MS-06 Zaku II Methamphetamine Gray Wolf Leopard gecko Wire Strap-on dildo Asbestos Public good Action potential Pump It Up Brewery Syringe Portland cement Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Diamond simulant Fox hunting Protein Drosophila melanogaster Carburetor Consensus decision-making Dog T-34 Parkinson's disease Growth hormone deficiency Antarctic krill
