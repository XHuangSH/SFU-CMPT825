turtle question i have a year old slider turtle and i want to get a baby turtle to go in the same cage do you think the bigger turtle will harm the little one if you get another turtle please quarantine it for a month before putting it in the other tank this is to prevent a any possible disease from getting to your two year old turtle how small of a turtle are you thinking of getting i had a three year old painted turtle and then put a one year old painted in with him and they were fine if you do decide to get this other turtle you will want to get one that is months to a year old in order to make sure that it's shell is hard enough to with stand being in with the other turtle a trick would be to clean the tank out before putting the turtles together then when the tank is ready put the smaller one in first and let it swim around for a while before putting the bigger one in this way the bigger turtle will think that it is in the smaller turtle's territory and they will therefore be nicer to each other watch them very carefully for about a week after you first put them together i have a year old and year old in a gallon tank and they get along great as another note watch the sexes of the turtles same sex turtles get along better they will occasionally fight for territory but this is normal and natural a good way to stop it though is to ground one to a small bucket and tell them that they are a very bad turtle turtles have personalities and they are all different setmefree male sliders grow up to a length of about inches and females grow up to about inches any questions please message me Sento Hamster Fire fighting Turtle Futurama (TV series - season 5) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Textile manufacturing Violin Dodge Charger Beaches of Hong Kong American lobster Sea turtle Cruising (maritime) GunBound Discworld (world) Second Battle of El Alamein Polish September Campaign Marine aquarium Terran (StarCraft) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Quarantine The Turtles Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Coconut crab Vegeta Domestic rabbit Ecco the Dolphin Rocko's Modern Life Equine conformation Knife Urinary incontinence Amateur telescope making Terminal ballistics Puberty Remora Professional wrestling match types Laws of cricket Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters Condom Mojave people Operation Barbarossa Penis Super Mario Bros.
