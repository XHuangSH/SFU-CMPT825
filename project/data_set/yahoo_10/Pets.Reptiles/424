would you trade i have a foot rock python and there is some one that has some corn snakes one male and a female both are babies how much do corn snake sell for and would you trade for them the price of the corns depends on what color they are if they are normal corns they are worth about each at a show maybe from a petstore personally i would trade if their is no shipping involved i wouldn't spend the money it would cost to ship i would much rather have a couple baby corns around than a rock rock are known to be mean sobs and get to a nice large size that require several people to handle them safely you also need to consider the issue of feeding and housing when the rock is larger you will have to build an enclosure and find someone that can supply you with large rabbits or even baby pigs it is much easier to care for and supply equipment and feeders for corns plus you can try your hand at breeding the corns they are gairly easy to breed and there is nothing more exciting than waiting for the eggs to pip and seeing little heads peeking out at you Hamster Fancy rat Guinea pig Alcohol fuel Agriculture Inflation Maize Burmese python Commodity markets Platypus Cat Fish farming Bulk vending Microeconomics Illegal drug trade CPU cache Seabird Nuclear power Poker jargon Externality Breastfeeding Zuiderzee Works Monetary policy Floppy disk Economic history of Canada Plastic Monopoly (game) Panama Canal Arguments for and against drug prohibition Chicken Supply and demand Equine conformation Energy development Commodore 64 Labor theory of value Spider Capital accumulation Chocobo Transformer Hyperinflation Pet skunk Fusion power M16 (rifle) Rabbit Moonshine Gas metal arc welding Economy of Norway Redundant array of independent disks Paintball RuneScape economy Domesticated turkey Honeybee Dairy Airport United States dollar Taboo food and drink Handloading Hard disk Law of value Falconry Shaggy dog story Dog Tax Genetically modified food Sea-Monkey Free trade Hydrogen economy Ferret My Little Pony Egg (food) Snake Python E85 Agricultural policy Deflation (economics) Garter snake Money supply Naval mine Domestication Emergency preparedness Goldfish Electrical wiring Reticulated Python Horse Economy of the United States Thermal power station Rise of Nations Scale model Agent handling Arbitrage Divorce Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina Bird feeder RISC Economy of Russia Dragons (Pern) Snake charming Callus
