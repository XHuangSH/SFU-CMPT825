im getting a bbaby bearded dragon if i use the uvb light and a heating pad tomaintainthe temp would it survive well it depends on the size of your cage and the wattage of the bulbs i've got a gallon aquarium with a watt light bulb and a heat mat and the temp in the room the aquarium is in stays around degrees the previous person who said that they can't feel heat on their belly's and there is an increased risk of burns is right however as long as you use cage carpet and the correct size heat mat you should be okay but if you are planning on using some type of substrate that they can move out of the way and lay directly on the glass over the heat mat there is a definite possibility for burns even though they cannot feel the heat on there belly's doesn't mean that the heat isn't penetrating through there skin and helping warm up there internal temps or the air around them my beardies love their mats and have not had any burn issues that being said you say uvb light are you talking about the kind that is shaped just like a regular light bulb even though these say on the package that they put off enough uvb light for reptiles they do not the only way to get enough uvb light is to use the tube shaped lights the repti sun is supposed to be pretty good i felt i had to add this because i've had my beardies for a couple of years now and thought like most people the other bulbs were what they needed and just found out a few months ago that is not the case beardies are at a higher risk of metabolic bone disease than other reptiles so their uvb requirements are a lot higher if you use the reptisun i don't believe it puts out much heat so you would still need a watt light bulb for heat but since you are providing your uvb requirements with the reptisun you can use a regular watt incandescent bulb and save some they are the same exact thing the pet store is selling you for a bulb any way and this way you get them for a but like i said you still have to have your uvb light as well the regular light bulbs are just for heat i've also heard that the little sticky thermometers don't measure the heat accurately so a digital thermometer is your best bet and for a baby the basking site is supposed to be degrees but if you are using a stick on don't try to get it this high cause your thermometer can be off by as much as degrees i feel the need to tell you all this cause these are the mistakes i made with my beardies and i spent so much money on the wrong stuff i was irate but since you're just starting out you can get the right stuff from the beginning and save yourself the hassle here's a good beardie group http pets groups yahoo com group pogona i have learned so much in there since i joined it's all beardie owners and breeders so they really know what they are talking about and give great advice it's better to know and have everything before you get the beardie that way you're not kicking yourself for getting the wrong stuff later like me also right now a gallon is ok since it's a baby but as an adult it's going to need at least a gallon aquarium mine is in an aquarium entirely too small and i'm working on getting that fixed too they make great pets though after you get the set up part of it all done good luck and have fun with your baby Fluorescent lamp Incandescent light bulb Light-emitting diode Psoriasis Ultraviolet Temperature Solar power Lighting Milk Strap-on dildo Aerial (dance move) Aquarium Vitamin D Theory of conduct Thermoregulation EastEnders Sunscreen Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bicycle lighting Compact fluorescent lamp Bearded Dragon Neighbours Sunburn Poker jargon Diode Equine conformation Explosive material Prostate cancer Ozone depletion Transformer Solar cell Houseplant Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Circuit design Microeconomics Eye Friends Headlight Ozone hole Stage lighting Nuclear power Breastfeeding Internal ballistics E85 Marine aquarium Supply and demand Brewery Eczema Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Professional wrestling holds Reef tank Floppy disk Domestic rabbit Betting (poker) Hand grenade Textile manufacturing Daylight saving time Hamster Care Bears Sento RuneScape skills Tank Handloading Mercury (element) Electrodeless lamp Carbon dioxide Charles Goodyear Characters in the Smurfs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Phoebe Halliwell Mixed martial arts Paragliding Futurama (TV series - season 5) Craps Dog Extreme Programming Bayesian inference Thermal power station Hypoglycemia Nuclear reactor Sun Welding Escherichia coli O157:H7 Transistor Future energy development Violin Causality Tuatara Laser Leaf The Silence (The Twilight Zone) Swimming pool Laser engraving Hearing impairment
