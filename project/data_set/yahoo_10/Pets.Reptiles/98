are corn snakes and corn milk snakes aggressive and where do each of them live no they are actually pretty timid shy creatures my niece has a male corn snake as a pet he is a beautiful snake with a lovely pattern of gold and orange and rust scales she feeds him thawed frozen mice it's not recommended to feed them live mice as the live ones may bite and scratch and hurt the snake she started him out on pinkies baby mice when he was young but now that he is fully grown he can eat small adults when she first got him he had a tank with some pebbles in the bottom and a log to hide in and she kept peering in to look at him even when he was hiding in the log he got annoyed with always being spied on so he piled pebbles up in front of the opening of the log so that she couldn't look in and see him anymore after that she learned to leave him alone more often she handles him frequently along with her two small sons and they don't ever get bitten unless they startle him he does get cranky when he's shedding though she's learned that it's best just to let him be at that time and not let the boys handle him i believe they are native to the prairies thus the gold and rust colored scales and are called corn snakes because they are often found hiding in corn fields planted in those areas Snake Shaggy dog story Snake charming Hamster RuneScape quests Maize Tarantula Dog Chicken Elephant Garter snake Fancy rat Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pet skunk House Mouse Ron and Fez Characters of Naruto FoxTrot Socialization Shen Gong Wu Goanna The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Domestic rabbit Breastfeeding Kangaroo The Adventures of Pete & Pete Comanche W.I.T.C.H.
