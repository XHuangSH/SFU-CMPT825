why dont people like reptiles and arachnids just kinda a recent question exept i added arachnids also im wondering how to get other people over their aracniphobia thanks it's funny we aren't actually born afraid of these things if you show a little kid a spider or a snake they want to touch it they're not scared of them so we're taught to be afraid of them through others and especially the media and think of halloween decorations scccary spiders what people should do if they want to get over these types of phobias is to meet with someone who's experienced with the animal and let the expert explain the truth about the species like interesting facts maybe later on have a harmless specimen brought in that they can look at and touch if they want my mom was less than thrilled when i brought my three and a half ft ball python rescue home her eyes nearly popped out of her head and she said something along the line of oh my god whenever she first tried to touch him she'd pull away as if expecting the snake to bite her now she'll hold out her arm for him to climb on as long as i'm still holding part of the snake she feels safe around him all of her friends and our relatives are disgusted and shocked she let me bring the python into the house she's still terrified of tarantulas but we'll cure these phobias one at a time remember baby steps Shaggy dog story Spider Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tarantula Snake Snake charming Garfield Moult Creatures in Bionicle Monty Python Milton H.
