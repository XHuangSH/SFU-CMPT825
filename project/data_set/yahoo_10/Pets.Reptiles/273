anole egg found hi everyone today i found what i think is an anole egg it was under the log i have put in their tank one of the male lizards was laying on it to keep it warm i called petco to see if i should take it out and they said yes so i did and it is under the light on a tupperware cover with mulch that is wet it is night time now and i am wondering if i should turn the light off for the night or lower the light and put the egg directly under the lamp and if you have any other advise on how to care for this egg and to keep it safe and alive i would greatly appreciate it also once it's hatched should i get another tank while it is still little thank you ps it looks like a hugh tic tac candy xs the size of a regular tic tac well stop and think the male laying on it isnt as hot as a lamp right u should keep the lamp on but put it at least inches away from the egg so that the egg doesnt get too hot and cook inches should keep it warm enough and i would definately get a small gallon aquarium or critter keeper box while it is a baby the bigger anoles will most likely eat the baby once it hatches if u put it in the same cage with them good luck Clownfish Tic-Tac-Dough Chicken Egg (food) Carolina Anole Platypus American lobster Shark Solar power Sea-Monkey Lizard Kakapo Goldfish Campfire Leatherback Sea Turtle Incandescent light bulb Tuatara Tarantula Mattress Emu Fluorescent lamp Marine aquarium Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kerosene lamp Octopus Grunion Hamster Diseases of the honeybee Halfbeak Headlight Coconut crab Grumpy's Three Wishes Grasshopper Capercaillie Care Bears Happy Tree Friends Egg (biology) Salmon Breakfast USS Yorktown (CV-5) Mantis shrimp Pysanka Minor Harry Potter Beasts Cruising (maritime) Japanese cuisine Antarctic krill Railway signalling Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Traffic light Bicycle lighting Bird Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Thermal power station American Alligator Eggerland series Tilapia Irrigation Kitchen Zerg Reef tank Comanche Beetle Cliff Richard Autonomous building Ladybird Ocean's Twelve Lighting Mulch Breastfeeding Strap-on dildo Cantonese cuisine STS-114 Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Frog Boom Town (Doctor Who) Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Aurora (astronomy) Glossary of firefighting terms Cuisine of Denmark Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Nile crocodile Compact fluorescent lamp Automotive lighting Snake Brewery Russian joke Jewish cuisine Mercury Atlas 6 Killifish Battle of Jutland YuYu Hakusho Railway signal Rocko's Modern Life Earthworm Tank Mercury 4 Seismic retrofit Ron and Fez
