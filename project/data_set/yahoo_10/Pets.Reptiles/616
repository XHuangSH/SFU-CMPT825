my baby bearded dragon is not eating i just got my baby bearded dragon yesterday from petsmart they said that they only feed them canned crickets so we bought them and hes not getting we also gave him some veggies and fruit he has a watt spot light on him all day and then at night he has a watt one of those redlights just so you know he has water and i dont think hes drinking that he is moving around and laying by the light but i dont know what to do i agree with the last answer petsmart or any petstore in my experience doesn't know enough to give good solid information on any particular animal they can keep them alive long enough to get them sold but for solid advice on keeping your pet alive you need to look else where ok that being said i agree with your last answer i'll add to that though that since you have a baby you might want to put him in a smaller enclosure when feeding the live crickets so that he can catch them easier and if he has trouble catching them i've heard that if you put the bag of crickets in the freezer for a minute it stuns them so they can't move as fast and your baby can catch them easier you need what is called pinhead crickets they are ity bity and when you get them you will need to put them in a baggy and add a little bit of calcuim powder to dust them with think shak n bake you can't leave the un eaten crickets in with your beardie or they will nibble at his toes when they start getting hungry i'm also assuming that petsmart didn't tell you that beardie's are at an increased risk for metabolic bone disease kinda like osteoprosis this is why they need there food dusted with calcuim powder you can find it in with the reptile supplies at the pet store it will be with the vitamins which i use as well after they get older and they don't have the proper lighting or calcuim supplements then they get the bone disease and their bones literally start breaking and your beardie can become paralyzed and mean he's in pain you can't blame them for not wanting to be messed with it's not pretty though what else can i say that petsmart probably didn't oh don't use sand at least not until they are adults their digestive system can't digest in and it gets caught inside them and kills them it's called impactation they make special calci sand that is supposed to be digestable but it's not if your beardie were to just eat a little of the calci sand it would pass through but since it's made out of calcuim most beardies will tend to eat large quantities of it and this makes it even more dangerous than regular play sand i personally don't use any type of sand for my beardies and they are adults but the only time i've heard of it being ok is if they are adults and you use play sand not calci sand um the basking spot temp should measure degrees and use a digitle thermometer the stick ons are off by as much as degrees either way back to your original question though mine are adults and don't drink their water some beardies love water and others don't just make sure that his food is misted or mist him even better if you let him swim around in your sink every once in a while water up to his shoulders make sure he can touch the bottom and water kinda warm but don't burn him then he will soak the water up through his vent and this will keep him from getting de hydrated i've heard that some beardies will eat baby food good not that i would suggest this as a main diet but if all else fails and he absoulutly refuses to eat anything then this might get him some nutrients try getting some mustard greens this is the closest we have in the us to what they eat in the wild when they are first born and they tend to like the taste of it better than other greens and some other veggies and putting them in a food processor with a drop or two of water and then see if he'll eat that as a baby he probably wont be too interested in his vegetables though it will want the live crickets i'm not even sure the canned ones are small enough for babies you never want what you are feeding him to be bigger than the space between his eyes here is a good yahoo group for beardie owners http pets groups yahoo com group pogona it is a site that has beardie breeders and owners on there and they give awesome advice you could join and then scan through their previous messages to get more advice or you could post a question in there
