crested geckos does anyone know of any sites where i can purchase baby crested geckos and what is easier for a beginer babys or juviniles do they like b handled i started out with babies so they could get to know me but i also rescued one from a petco that had ripped of her tail and she has become very sweet first they need care but they are not hard to care for they need at least gallons each and a tall terrarium i use those gallon breeders with sliding door turned on its side it's nice and tall however if you get a baby it's better to start with a smaller container so they don't get overwhelmed or have trouble finding their food they eat a crested gecko diet you can purchase from petstores or online they can also eat some crickets dusted with calcium or certain fruits or sugarfree organic babyfoods also with calcium they get sick if they don't get enough calcium so the special diet is a good way to ensure it they also need humidity so mist them twice a day they need room temps so don't get a heat lamp give them a ton of stuff to climb on or their tails can be damaged give them water dish just in case but not big enough to drown in their tails come off easily and don't grow back so be very gentle they get used to you with time but never stress them or chase them around and by no means pick them up by their tail if they lose it they will be fine as long as it heals ok but it is nice for them to have to help with climbing and jumping anyway i like to see mine in person before i purchase you can rescue one from a petco or petsmart or find a local reptile dealer there are a variety of good dealers online also good luck Hamster Domestic rabbit Phelsuma Gecko Equine conformation Chicken Tooth Japanese tea ceremony Shen Gong Wu Fire fighting Coeliac disease RuneScape quests Watermelon Milk Tofu Pet skunk Fancy rat The Time Machine Carbon dioxide Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Veganism Skateboarding trick Illegal drug trade Madagascar day gecko Food Marine aquarium Cliff Richard Cannabis cultivation American lobster Goldfish Dog The McGuire Sisters Tung Chung Craps Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Aerial (dance move) RuneScape Random Events Super Mario 64 Apple Potato Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Uranium Leopard gecko Sento Brewery Social rule Tank Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Discus (fish) Cat Egg (food) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bubble Bobble Tomato Cuisine of Denmark Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Conker's Bad Fur Day Monster Rancher monsters Calcium Thermal power station The Amber Spyglass Mountaineering Characters in the Smurfs Carnivorous plant Fire extinguisher Mario Mao (game) Kodocha Surveillance Nutrition Fecal incontinence Care Bears Nile crocodile Humphrey Bogart Budgerigar Nuclear power Codename: Kids Next Door Final Fantasy IV Plastic Mario series enemies Dishwasher Tooth enamel Raw food diet Betting (poker) Floppy disk Vegetarianism International cricket in 2005 The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Moult Gliding Bulk vending Gray Wolf
