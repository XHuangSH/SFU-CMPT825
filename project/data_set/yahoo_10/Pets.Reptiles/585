red eared slider turtle feeding questions i have two questions about feeding my two red eared sliders first can you feed your turtles in a different pattern i know that usually you should feed them a lot of food every two to three days but would it be better to just feed them a little bit a few times a day or about half as much once a day just wondering my second question is what brand of pelleted turtle food do you think is best also is a mostly vegetarian diet ok for red eared sliders i do feed them a little cooked chicken and beef but i don't eat a lot of meat and my mom does not buy a lot of it so we don't usually have a lot of it also they foul the water really fast i mostly feed them lots of different kinds of lettuce and fruits and vegetables lastly will the turtles eat outside the water in a seperate box thanks they are fully grown and adults i can't feed them in a seperate tank because i don't have one but i clean out the water when it gets dirty and i have a powerful filter it doesn't matter if you feed them in a pattern they will know when it's feeding time i would feed them a little bit everyday my turtle loves the hbh turtle bites if they're adults a mostly vegetarian diet is fine but a little meat won't hurt they cannot eat outside of the water they need the water to swallow their food they might be too nervous to eat outside of their tank hope this helps good luck Hamburger Guinea pig Vegetarianism Domestic rabbit Chicken Food Peruvian cuisine Egg (food) Tofu Japanese cuisine Chili con carne Kashrut Dieting Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler McDonald's Hot dog Cuisine of the Southern United States Korean cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Hamster Escherichia coli O157:H7 Bengali cuisine Cat Tooth French cuisine Jewish cuisine Raw food diet Factory farming Fasting Dim sum Meat Vegetarianism and religion Ramen Shrimp farm Breastfeeding Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Vietnam MRE Sea-Monkey Taboo food and drink Maize Cuisine of Malaysia Livestock Breakfast Fish and chips Cajun cuisine Pork Rocko's Modern Life Omega-3 fatty acid Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Chinese cuisine Domesticated turkey Dumpling W.I.T.C.H.
