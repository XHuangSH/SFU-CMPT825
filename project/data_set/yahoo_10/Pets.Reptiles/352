sick iguana updated i posted a question before because my iguanas head was tilted to one side i came downstairs this morning and realized what has been happening the cat was actually in the cage it's not as if the cage does not have a cover but somehow the cat was managing to sneak in at night now my iguana is just lying there it is not dead i called the vet and they said that it may have a broken bone which is why it is not moving right or it could be brain damage but they could not really do anything to save it if it has internal bleeding or brain damage there are no open wounds but he is just lying there i have a ton of heat on him a little warmer than usual but i was wondering if it is broken bones and shock if he can recover i had no idea that this was happening i feel horrible oh my sorry to hear this i hope you can heal the little guy my thoughts are with you First aid Sin City Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Traumatic brain injury Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Futurama (TV series - season 2) Rent (musical) Futurama (TV series - season 3) One Piece minor characters Head Breath of Fire III Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sabretooth (comics) The Shining (film) Wound Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma USS Yorktown (CV-5) Dinosaur Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Poker jargon Bleeding Futurama (TV series - season 4) A Canticle for Leibowitz Futurama (TV series - season 5) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Tuatara Motorcycle helmet Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Healing Naruto jutsu The Jazz Singer Triage Kain (Legacy of Kain) The Catcher in the Rye Skull Treasure Island Second Battle of El Alamein Bone fracture John Cage Series finale Escape from New York Days of our Lives Autopsy Blood (computer game) Out-of-body experience The Champions Characters of Naruto Blood on the Tracks About Schmidt Avenue Q Planet of the Daleks Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Venom (comics) Pressure point Trench warfare StarCraft: Uprising Battles of Lexington and Concord Stomach cancer Conspiracy (TNG episode) The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Tyrannosaurus rex The Death Gate Cycle Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Shaggy dog story Bombing of Dresden in World War II Equine conformation Bruise RMS Titanic USS West Virginia (BB-48) USS Amberjack (SS-219) The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) Avalanche Hip hop rivalries Vomiting Unconscious mind Aerial (dance move) Limit Break The Ark in Space Radiation poisoning Darwin from Orchids to Variation Belfast blitz Chronic fatigue syndrome USS Trigger (SS-237) RoboCop Sharon Tate Aliens of London Trainspotting (novel) Pok__mon Live!
