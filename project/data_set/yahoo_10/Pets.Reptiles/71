what kind of tadpoles do i have i live in northern california and recently brought home about tadpoles from a nearby stream they're all doing great and seem to be thriving i'm just curious as to what kind they are they're about half an inch long maybe a bit smaller there's a few that are much smaller i think they must be younger they're kind of a black color with what appears to be golden spots they have silver bellies their bodies aren't as round as most tadpoles bodies seem to be and their tails are pretty thin and about the same length as their body i think they're about days old their eyes are developed and their mouths seem to be developed too they're eating algae tablets and goldfish flakes thanks if you took the tadpoles out of a pond then you should be able to take them to a pet store and they will tell you Goldfish Hamster Cheetah Bladderwort Stoat Meriones unguiculatus The Legend of Zelda series enemies Cat Frog Koi Fancy rat Smelt American lobster Notostraca Shark Minor Harry Potter Beasts Puma Polychrotidae Nile crocodile Tooth enamel Guinea pig Leopard Potato House Mouse American Alligator Domestic rabbit Black panther Snake Violin Tiger Characters of The Sandman Color Poliwag Tasmanian Devil Silver Internal ballistics Capercaillie Equine conformation Turkish Van Pizza Gray Wolf Island Fox Animal communication Textile manufacturing Hot dog Peanut Saxophone Amphibian Yellow Giant Neotropical Toad Tincture (heraldry) JPEG Fugu Crocodile Blue Whale Unicorn Toad Sleeping with the Enemy (Simpsons episode) Decline in frog populations Audio tape length and thickness Garter snake Drill bit Pachypodium baronii Floppy disk Pond Zinc Franklin (television series) Predaceous diving beetle Spring Peeper Gecko Tarantula Kissing gourami Pachypodium ambongense Poliwhirl Hair Spot the Dog Cat coat genetics New Albion Dog Roundworm Dobermann Recumbent bicycle Hydra (genus) Poker jargon Colours, standards and guidons YuYu Hakusho American Water Shrew Taikyoku shogi Vegeta Xenomorph Cartridge (firearms) Ecology Stream Dragonfly Corroboree frog Bullfrog Jiuzhaigou Valley Terminal ballistics Solar power
