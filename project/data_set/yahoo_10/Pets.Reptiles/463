is a x x inch long vivarium ok for a fully gorwn beardie it is also gallons nope sorry an adult beardie can grow up to inches long so you're gonna need something that is more of a cage and less of a coffin try giving him something that is at least twice his length long his length wide and one and a half his length tall so if he's two feet long you're looking at feet long two feet wide and three feet high but that's the minimum you want to be giving him if you're having trouble finding a tank for him as a dessert animal he doesn't have to be in ultra wet humiditys so you can build a netting sort of terrium for him to crawl around on on top just nail a bunch of metal wire stuff to two by fours just make sure it's good and sturdy and that the holes in the netting isn't big enough for him to get his leg through or he could get caught and break things Textile manufacturing Laws of cricket Drill bit Volleyball Poker jargon English unit Equine conformation Seismic retrofit Nine Inch Nails Fast bowling Knife Violin Horseshoe Barbed wire Campfire Terminal ballistics Dodge Charger Tire Stairway Rail tracks Professional wrestling holds Basketball Diving Pachypodium baronii Scale model Chair Childbirth Screw Carbon dioxide Tokusatsu Hamster Slide rule Firearm U.S. customary units Dog agility Wire Professional wrestling attacks Clarinet Apollo Command/Service Module Super Mario 64 Cruising (maritime) Floppy disk Drywall Punt (boat) View camera Smelt Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Doom enemies Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Roller hockey Goaltender Broomball Mattress Professional wrestling match types Table tennis Strap-on dildo Marine aquarium Brush Lacrosse Puberty Shark Guinea pig Combine (Half-Life 2) Junk (ship) Hair Domestic rabbit Paper size Brewery Shotgun Trapping Fancy rat Codename: Kids Next Door Billiards Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Make money fast RuneScape quests Aerial (dance move) Cannabis cultivation Time Out of Mind Fossil fuel power plant Jam (TV series) Pachypodium ambongense Coconut crab Imperial unit Torpedo Textile manufacturing terminology Glossary of firefighting equipment Quicksort Pok__mon Live!
