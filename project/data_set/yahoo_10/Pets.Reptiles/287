has anyone been bitten by their ball python i'll admit i haven't been a very good pet parent as of recently i'm a single parent of a crazy two year old who has recently taken lots of my time it's summer i haven't really had much contact with my snake other than feeding watering i haven't handled her in probably a month i'd like to get her out and spend some time with her this weekend but i'm a little nervous anyone else gone a few weeks without handling and then tried she's never struck before you just never know i've been bitten plenty of times there's nothing to worry about it doesn't matter too much if you haven't handled them for a while i think it depends more on their personality some are more easy going others are more timid and then you get those that have a lot of attitude a defensive strike really doesn't hurt that much i would much rather get bit by a ball than say a puppy or kitten that was playing around the only difference is the shock factor because they're so quick usually the defensive strikes will be over before you know you've been bit just move slow and approach the snake from the back instead reaching towards the head most of the time even a very agressive ball will mellow out as soon as you have him in your hands oh and make sure you weren't handling any rats or mice before reaching in i know that sounds obvious but many people forget and will end up with a feeding strike feeding strikes aren't that bad either but the snake will coil up and hold on for perhaps a few minutes you're not in danger of anything but it's a little more frightening if you're not expecting it just wait until the snake lets go or run the snake under cold water feeding strikes are really uncommon though Fast bowling Volleyball Shaggy dog story Social rule Theory of conduct Dog training Snake Table tennis Snake charming Ron and Fez Softball 1957 World Series Breastfeeding I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Baseball Equine conformation Hamster Naval mine Textile manufacturing Haven (TNG episode) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Paintball Cricket Socialization Kender The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Rugby union positions Snooker EastEnders Tag Kim Possible Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Guinea pig New York Giants Garfield Dog Toilet humour Tai shogi Croquet Pet skunk Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Escape from New York Blood (computer game) Atomic Kitten RuneScape quests Nine Inch Nails Norway national football team Time Out of Mind Feral cat Pump It Up American football Water polo Hey Jude Kodocha Dualism (philosophy of mind) Swingout Ball python CPU cache Spider Worms weapons and tools M16 (rifle) Treehouse of Horror IX Eric Cartman Fancy rat Pinball Piccolo Junior Saga Ferret StarCraft Secret Missions Martial art Unreal Ron Weasley Poker jargon Futurama (TV series - season 5) Hypoglycemia GunZ The Duel Eight ball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Rugby league positions StarCraft Episode VI Ravi Shastri Mouse (computing) Lightning Babe Ruth Goanna The Contender (television series) Professional wrestling slang Floppy disk Characters in the Smurfs Pete Sampras Aerial (dance move) Mach kernel American football strategy Fielding (cricket) Hermione Granger
