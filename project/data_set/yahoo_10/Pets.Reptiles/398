i'm planning to get a lizard for my birthday i'm planning to get a lizard i'm from the uk so with food the tank and all other needs how much will it cost all together there's a lot of things to consider before you do this what type of lizard do you want is it herbivorous omnivorous or carnivorous how big does it get what type of lighting heating substrate does it need how much humidity does it need reptiles are every bit as big a responcibility as a dog or a cat in some ways they're more of a responcibility they can live a lot longer than 'conventional pets' and have to be socialized played with often many times they will end up needing much larger and more expensive enclosures as adults than they do as babies and it's incredibly hard to find a good reptile vet when they get sick my suggestion is this buy a book on the lizard species you're thinking of getting and study it hard ultimately a lizard may not be the best choice of a pet but if it is the book is definately worth the investment also do not get a heat rock for any lizard as they can easily burn themselves to death on it read the guidelines for heating out of the book and follow them the initial cost of a lizard can vary greatly from eighty us dollars for the lizard and setup to many thousands of dollars for the same my honest reccomendation is if you've never had a reptile before get an anole or a leopard gecko they're the easiest to care for don't take up a lot of space and can be a lot of fun inital cost of both of these is between sixty and two hundred us dollars don't know the pound equivalents sorry i do hope this helps Lizard Reptile Dog Gecko Cat Tyrannosaurus rex Carnivore Ferret Creatures in Bionicle Garfield Hydrogen economy Solar power Marine aquarium Brown Bear Fauna of Australia Pet Leopard gecko Livestock Snake Welding Social rule Solar cell Crocodilia Tiger Minor Harry Potter Beasts Paleocene Polychrotidae Cruising (maritime) Health insurance Microeconomics Alcohol fuel Timeline of alternative rock Cheetah Fancy rat Nuclear power Gerald Durrell Tooth Theory of conduct American Alligator Carnivora Domestic rabbit Leopard Explosive material Capital accumulation Cryptozoology Ra (board game) Pet store Bearded Dragon Thermoregulation Largest organism Endangered species United States dollar Lizard (comics) Euro Extreme Programming Sewage treatment Internal ballistics Carnivorous plant Illegal drug trade Dialysis Broadband Internet access Pitaten Care Bears Bicycle lighting Kodocha RuneScape quests Fossil Scientology beliefs and practices Hard disk Hyperinflation Puma Veterinarian Solar panel Sea-Monkey Tetrapod Leatherback Sea Turtle Microchip implant (animal) Carbon dioxide Plesiosaur Alcoholics Anonymous Discus (fish) Lighting Autonomous building Discordianism Tooth enamel The Fairly OddParents CPU design Neopets Divorce Password
