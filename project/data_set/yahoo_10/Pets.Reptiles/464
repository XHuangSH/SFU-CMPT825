reptile help i would like to know what would hurt more a bite from a ball python or an iguana both full grown i have been bitten by an iguana and a rat snake before but never a ball python i don't think you would have to worry about a ball python bite since they are so docile it would take a lot to get one to bite you but in answer to your question i think a iguana would hurt more iguana bites are not that bad either its their tail whips and claws that hurt Snake Iguana Goanna Lizard Creatures in Bionicle Ball python Burmese python Pet Blood (computer game) Monty Python and the Holy Grail Green Iguana Hamster Animal Reptile Computer numbering formats Theory of conduct Unreal Shaggy dog story Tarantula Aurelian Smith, Jr. Whip Piccolo Junior Saga Vegeta Boa Ron and Fez Felis sapiens Tuatara Serpent Society Krypto the Superdog Meat The Legend of Zelda series enemies Snake handling Social rule Rattlesnake Legends of the Hidden Temple Australian megafauna Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl Snake charming Inspector Gadget Monty Python Sea snake Sinfest Ava Gardner Doom enemies American Alligator I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Taronga Zoo Python Bristol Zoo Gal__pagos Islands Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat Remus Lupin Sydney Riot of 1879 Krait Undead (Discworld) Hun-Apu Characters of Naruto Fauna of Australia Wobbuffet R-Type InuYasha (character) Jabberwocky Rich Mullins Samuel Goldwyn Ferret John Cleese Monty Python's Flying Circus Meta-reference The Secret of NIMH Hurt (song) OutKast Rod Stewart Inherently funny word M.A.S.K.
