i gave a zoomed turtle bone to my pet turtle now its been week and he hasn't even nibbled what should i do so yeah its been over a week and he hasn't took a bite i just wanted to give calcium to my turtle easier and faster oh and i know this is kindof off topic but i finally got to building an outdoor place for my turtle he use to crawl on the screen porch but now he has enviroment which he enjoys happily turtles and tortoises are very self sufficient in that if they need the calcium and its available to them they will eat it he might just not feel the need i would leave it there and if he wants it he will certainly nibble it Tooth Turtle WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Party Game$ Shredder (TMNT) Calcium Sea turtle Leatherback Sea Turtle Hamster Konami Code Franklin (television series) Koopa Troopa Reptile Hansel und Gretel Plaster Coconut crab Dinosaur Tofu Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) Pet Tortoise Cecil Turtle Guinea pig Colorectal cancer Bohemian Rhapsody Computer numbering formats INMOS Transputer Pet skunk Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fancy rat Viacom One Piece minor characters I Ching divination Strontium Cat Domestic rabbit The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Bat Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Turtles Bugs Bunny Osteoporosis Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (comic book) Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Tarantula Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Kenny McCormick Rickets Mario Bros.
