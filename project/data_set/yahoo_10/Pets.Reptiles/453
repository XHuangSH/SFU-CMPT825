if you have leos please answer i have a leo and so does my brother they are in different cages and one is a girl and we do not know the sex of mine i have not played with mine in a long time and i picked it up today and it hissed me and bit me times i was trying to see if it was a boy or a girl and i was so scared that i dropped it i don't ever play with it and my brother plays with his he has a huge tank i mean like gallons and only one gecko in it mine is a gallon and i one in it too can we put our leos in the same cage his a a little bigger and nicer then mine also how can i get my gecko out of it's cage with out him her biting me so that i can tell the gender i tried picking her up with a wash cloth and she yelped and it scared me so i dropped her again last time i time my brother even got scared when she did that could i reach in there and scoop her in the clear glass go slower remember you are thousands of times bigger than she is start by putting your hand in the tank and leaving it there wait until she comes over and investigates don't try to pick her up let her lick you and walk on your hand get some wax worms and hold them in your hand while your leopard gecko eats them then when she's totally comfortable with you start raising your hand a little when she climbs on it then you can gently but firmly start to pick her up from below and holding her but go slow over a couple of weeks she needs to know that you aren't going to hurt her i hardly ever handle my leopard geckos but if you learn to approach them without scaring them you can minimize your chances of getting bit i will agree that if they are both females then yes you can put them together males will kill each other and a male and female combo will stress each other out breeding is very hard on females and unless you are committed to doing it right and have somewhere to sell the babies it isn't worth it Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City Equine conformation Ron and Fez Social rule Gecko Naval mine Skateboarding trick Lion RuneScape Random Events Dog training Salad Fingers RuneScape quests Milton H.
