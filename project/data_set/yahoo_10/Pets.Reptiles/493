year old son wants a reptile what kind of reptile would be good for a year old i do reptile programs for our local libraries and children's museum i always tell parents that either a bearded dragon or a ball python are good choices for a first reptile because they are sturdy and will tolerate alot of handling they are also of a pretty even temperament and not liable to bite your child and they do not harbor salmonella as most aquatic turtles do you may prefer a bearded dragon because the only live prey it will eat is crickets they are basically vegetarians both are inexpensive and do not require a great deal to set up an enclosure a tank with a top a source of uv light bedding and a water dish you may also need to provide a heat pad during the colder months i suggest placing it under the tank so your reptile does not injure itself Reptile Tuatara Leatherback Sea Turtle Creatures in Bionicle V.F.D.
