cynical romance i made this not quite a poem up the other day or so and i finished it just before i posted it here since it's more of a humourous sort of thing let me know what you think love hasn't been that good to me infact it's been a bastard i guess that's why i'm cynical and such a hard and cranky old basket sure being single isn't exactly wonderful but it's better than being around a bunch of perky neanderthals love and marriage horse and carriage stuff that i'd rather take the horse and ride off into the sunset thanks no go away piss off mate i don't want your kids why don't you bugger off you w a n k look buddy don't you understand english i said n o yes that's right shoo you blow fly and g o unwanted male and female attention can really smell and heck does it stink so i locked my romance in a padded cell and then i said fare thee well s n hammond first off i'm not insane and i don't hate love ian drury actually inspired this lol that is deep with some serious underlying issues Time Out of Mind Sin City Russian joke AFI 100 Years series EastEnders "Weird Al" Yankovic The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Friends Beatles for Sale Ron and Fez 10cc Futurama (TV series - season 5) Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
