have you heard the joke about the poison watermelon this dude had a wattermellon stolen from his patch and put up a sign saying' beware one of these wattermellons is now poison the next morning there was another sign that said now you beware two of these wattermellons are now poison i think the point is that the thief had come back and retaliated it doesn't matter whether the dude had actually poisoned one of his own watermelons or had just put up the sign to frighten off the thief he wouldn't have known if the thief was for real either or which one he would have poisoned if he had been for real so all the watermelons would have to be discarded anyway Ocean's Twelve Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Joker (comics) MapleStory The Tale of the Body Thief Johnny 5 Clown Denis Leary Waking the Dragons Quest for Glory The Marshall Mathers LP Vlad III Dracula Kimi Finster The Hobbit Jackass: The Movie Ragnarok Online FoxTrot Anne Rice Breath of Fire III Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Curse of Fenric YuYu Hakusho Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Juggalo Spidey Super Stories Steven Wright Bart's Girlfriend Wayne's World 2 Cheating in poker Blink-182 Oh My Goddess!
