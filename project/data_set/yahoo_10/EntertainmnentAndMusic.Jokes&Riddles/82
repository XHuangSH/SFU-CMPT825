i think that this is funny two men are sitting at the bar at the top of the empire state building drinking when the first guy turns to the other one and says you know last week i discovered if you jump from the top of this building by the time you fall to the th floor the wind around the building is so intense it carries you back into the window the bartender just shakes his head in disapproval while wiping the bar but says nothing the second guy says what are you insane there's no way that could happen no it's true said the first guy let me prove it to you he gets up from the bar jumps over the balcony and plummets toward the street below when he passes the th floor the wind whips him in the window and he takes the elevator back up to the bar the second guy is astonished you know i saw that with my own eyes but it must've been a fluke that was scientifically impossible no i'll prove it again says the first man as he jumps again just his body hurtles towards the street the wind whips him into the th floor window he takes the elevator back to the bar once upstairs he successfully urges his dubious fellow drinker to try it well what the heck the second guy says i've seen that it works so i'll try he jumps over the balcony and rapidly plunges downwards his body hits the pavement with a loud splat back upstairs the bartender who had been silent the whole time turns to the first drinker and shakes his head and says you know superman you're a real bastard when you're pissed that's the best joke i have heard all year The Shining (film) Professional wrestling attacks The Boondock Saints Sin City Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) Swingout Avenue Q Guilty Gear Volleyball Toilet humour Professional wrestling holds The Parting of the Ways Professional wrestling aerial techniques Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Stairway The Dalek Invasion of Earth Glossary of ballet terms Futurama (TV series - season 4) Lex Luthor Billboard Hot 100 The Star Wars Holiday Special Good Morning, Vietnam Jackass: The Movie Oriel College, Oxford Max Payne Milton H.
