squirrel question just for entertainment first correct answer with explaination gets the points a squirrel climbs a tree that is m high with a circumference of m suppose the squirrel climbs the tree in a uniform upward spiral turning times around the tree how far did the squirrel travel here's my guess if you go directly around the tree three times without goes up you would travel meters if you went directly up without going around it would be metres so you can use these values as a right angled triangle to work out the hypotonuse a squared b squared c squared where a b and c the hypotonuse or the distance the squirrel travelled so therefore c the squirrel travelled metres i hope this explanation makes sense Tide Metre Speed of light Kepler's laws of planetary motion Gravity Volleyball Species Pi Softball Basketball Force Sun Circle The nature of God in Western theology Expert system Eye GED Collision detection Stairway Scientology beliefs and practices Glider Theory of conduct Zeno's paradoxes Yosemite Valley Normal distribution Triangle Ethernet Crossword Helicopter Jumpstart 3rd Grade Standard deviation Time travel Archimedes Sierra Nevada (US) Antenna (radio) Hyperbolic geometry Sundial Milky Way Four square Northern Flying Squirrel Geodesy Snooker Squirrel Hipparchus (astronomer) Aristarchus Conker's Bad Fur Day Many-worlds interpretation Maxwell's equations Starfleet ranks and insignia Torque Trigonometric function Scrabble (game show) Glossary of graph theory Napier's bones Angle Fixed-wing aircraft Symmetry Great Pyramid of Giza Solar system Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Catalan number Bayesian inference Parabola Charge (heraldry) String theory Robert Goddard (scientist) Pascal's triangle Billiards Sail-plan Labor theory of value On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Quantum computer Pythagorean theorem Wa shogi Opportunity rover ATLAS experiment Complex number Professional wrestling holds Gee EPR paradox Eratosthenes Phillips curve GunBound View camera Supernatural Avalanche Now You See It Coriolis effect Depth of field Sciurinae Transformer Faster-than-light Problem of universals Polyhedron Overhead lines Cerebellum Tsunami Solar power Alhazen
