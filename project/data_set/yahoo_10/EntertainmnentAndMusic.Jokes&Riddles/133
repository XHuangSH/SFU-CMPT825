no doubt russians are good in chess after months of negotiation with the authorities a talmudist from odessa in russia was granted permission to visit moscow he boarded the train and found an empty seat at the next stop a young man got on and sat next to him the scholar looked at the young man and thought this fellow doesn't look like a peasant and if he isn't a peasant he probably comes from this district if he comes from this district then he must be jewish because this is after all a jewish district on the other hand if he is a jew where could he be going i'm the only jew in our district who has permission to travel to moscow ahh but just outside moscow there is a little village called samvet and jews don't need special permission to go there but why would he be going to samvet he's probably going to visit one of the jewish families there but how many jewish families are there in samvet only two the bernsteins and the steinbergs the bernsteins are a terrible family and a nice looking fellow like him must be visiting the steinbergs but why is he going the steinbergs have only daughters so maybe he's their son in law but if he is then which daughter did he marry they say that sarah married a nice lawyer from budapest and esther married a businessman from zhitomer so it must be sarah's husband which means that his name is alexander cohen if i'm not mistaken but if he comes from budapest with all the anti semitism they have there he must have changed his name what's the hungarian equivalent of cohen kovacs but if they allowed him to change his name he must have some special status what could it be a doctorate from the university at this point the scholar turns to the young man and says how do you do dr kovacs very well thank you sir answered the startled passenger but how is it that you know my name oh replied the talmudist it was obvious huh tired ha ha ha i know it's too big and descriptive but that's the whole thing about chess dear prashant d this one is for the archives i loved it so true they are indeed gifted in this area the point taken that they see all the moves before the game is played i have never seen the game of chess played out in words before in this manner thank you quite a chuckle Russian joke Jos__ Ra__l Capablanca Fiddler on the Roof Karl Marx Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union Cultural and historical background of Jesus Historical Jesus Jacob Pavlovitch Adler World Chess Championship Eastern Orthodox Church Rabbi Pharisees Humphrey Bogart Kohen Korban Ludwig Wittgenstein Israel ben Eliezer Bobby Fischer Chess opening Odessa Halakha Apocrypha Anti-Semitism Jew Paul of Tarsus Kashrut Baroque chess Satan Jewish mythology Mishnah Nahmanides Family name Yeshu Free will Chess strategy and tactics Abraham Joshua Heschel Maimonides Names of God in Judaism Chess Shaggy dog story Jesus Kasparov versus The World Chess (musical) Purim Computer chess Repentance Religion in Israel Book of Esther Lauren Bacall Jewish humour Hebrew language Night (book) Soviet Union Kyle Broflovski Ruy Lopez Paul Morphy Eastern Front (World War II) Ten Commandments Women in Islam Yusuf al-Qaradawi Anatoly Karpov Death (personification) Garry Kasparov Zohar Amidah Jewish philosophy Chess variant Xiangqi Names and titles of Jesus Baal teshuva Khazar Correspondence The Holocaust Theodicy Romanov Chess problem Role of women in Judaism The Inside Jewish principles of faith Idolatry Negima B__la Kun Acts of the Apostles Baal Jewish ethics Singlish
