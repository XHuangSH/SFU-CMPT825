can you explain these riddles it gets harder yet a man was found dead in his study he was slumped over his desk and a gun was in his hand there was a cassette recorder on his desk when the police entered the room and pressed the play button on the tape recorder they heard i can't go on i have nothing to live for then there was the sound of a gunshot how did the detective immediately know that the man had been murdered and it wasn't a suicide one day a father went to his three sons and told them that he would die soon and he needed to decide which one of them to give his property to he decided to give them all a test he said go to the market my sons and purchase something that is large enough to fill my bedroom but small enough to fit in your pocket from this i will decide who of you is the wisest and is worthy enough to inherit my land so they all went to the market and bought something that they thought would fill the room yet was still small enough that they could fit into their pocket each son came back with a different item the father told his sons to come into his bedroom one at a time and try to fill up his bedroom with whatever they had purchased the first son came in and put some pieces of cloth that he had bought and laid them end to end across the room but it barely covered any of the floor then the second son came in and laid some hay that he had purchased on the floor but there was only enough to cover half of the floor the third son came in and showed his father what he had purchased and how it could fill the entire room yet still fit into his pocket the father replied you are truly the wisest of all and you shall receive my property what was it that the son had showed to his father you have to explain them bonus answer these and have a better shot at getting best answer imagine you are in a room no doors windows or anything how do you get out one morning a man is leaving on business trip and finds he left some paperwork at his office he runs into his office to get it and the night watchman stops him and says sir don't get on the plane i had a dream last night that the plane would crash and everyone would die the man takes his word and cancels his trip sure enough the plane crashes and everyone dies the next morning the man gives the watchman a reward for saving his life and then fires him why did he fire the watchman that saved his life so far all of them have been answered but no one person has them all right so if no one gets it within an hour i'm going to give it to allicat because she was the first to answer the first two the first one if he had commited suicide who could of stopped and rewound the tape it said he just pressed play no idea oh wait he bought a match and it filled the room with light Escape from New York Blood Simple Columbine High School massacre Donald Neilson Shaggy dog story Dial M for Murder Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Hobbit Paul Is Dead Miss Saigon James Hanratty Poker jargon Sin City Syphon Filter Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jean Charles de Menezes Survivor (novel) Rose (Doctor Who) Mattress Operation Market Garden The Amber Spyglass The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases StarCraft: Uprising Max Payne The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Conker's Bad Fur Day The Parting of the Ways Richard Chase Sola fide United Airlines Flight 93 The Champions Charles Peace Heinkel He 112 The Shining (film) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Zhao Yun The Apprentice 2 Leo Frank Jonestown September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Animal Crossing Fancy Crane Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Mouse (computing) USS Tunny (SS-282) USS Trigger (SS-237) Wheel of Fortune Father's Day (Doctor Who) John F.
