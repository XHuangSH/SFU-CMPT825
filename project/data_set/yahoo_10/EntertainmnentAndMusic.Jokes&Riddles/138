produce for a green marble or an orange one perhaps i left the stand smiling to myself impressed with this man a short time later i moved to colorado but i never forgot the story of this man the boys and their bartering several years went by each more rapid that the previous one just recently i had occasion to visit some old friends in that idaho community and while i was there learned that mr miller had died they were having his viewing that evening and knowing my friends wanted to go i agreed to accompany them upon arrival at the mortuary we fell into line to meet the relatives of the deceased and to offer whatever words of comfort we could ahead of us in line were three young men one was in an army uniform and the other two wore nice haircuts dark suits and white shirts all very professional looking they approached mrs miller standing composed and smiling by her husband's casket each of the young men hugged her kissed her on the cheek spoke briefly with her and moved on to the casket her misty light blue eyes followed them as one by one each young man stopped briefly and placed his own warm hand over the cold pale hand in the casket each left the mortuary awkwardly wiping his eyes our turn came to meet mrs miller i told her who i was and mentioned the story she had told me about the marbles with her eyes glistening she took my hand and led me to the casket those three young men who just left were the boys i told you about they just told me how they appreciated the things jim traded them now at last when jim could not change his mind about color or size they came to pay their debt we've never had a great deal of the wealth of this world she confided but right now jim would consider himself the richest man in idaho with loving gentleness she lifted the lifeless fingers of her deceased husband resting underneath were three exquisitely shined red marbles Friends Sin City Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart
