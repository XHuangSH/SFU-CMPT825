the guys are going to like this one sorry ladies the wife came home from work early and found her husband in their bedroom making love to a very attractive young woman understandably she was somewhat upset you are a disrespectful pig she cried how dare you do this to me a faithful wife the mother of your children i'm leaving you i want a divorce straight away her husband replied hang on just a minute luv i can explain what happened you can try she sobbed but they'll be the last words you'll say to me and the husband began well i was getting into the car to drive home and this young lady here asked me for a lift she looked so down and out and defenseless that i took pity on her and let her into the car i noticed that she was very thin not well dressed and very dirty she told me that she hadn't eaten for three days so in my compassion i brought her home and warmed up the soup i made for you last night the soup that you wouldn't eat because you're afraid you'll put on weight the poor thing devoured three bowls in moments since she needed a good clean up i suggested a shower and while she was doing that i noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so i threw them away then as she needed clothes i gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years but don't use because you say they are too tight i also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present which you don't use because i don't have good taste i found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for christmas that you don't use just to annoy her and i also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don't use because someone at work has the same pair then he took a quick breath and pressed on she was so grateful for my understanding and help and as i walked her to the door she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said please do you have anything else that your wife doesn't use i have never heard i before it's a really good one thanks for the laugh Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Marilyn Monroe Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Time Out of Mind Night (book) Friends Little Britain Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Knots Landing The Jazz Singer Teen Girl Squad EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Piccolo Junior Saga Marie Antoinette Jon Secada About a Boy Mojave people The Shining (film) Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 613 mitzvot Jam (TV series) Rais massacre Pitaten Salad Fingers Joke Phoebe Buffay's songs The Smoking Room Ocean's Twelve Eddie Guerrero Saki Sin City Ayyavazhi mythology Comanche Characters in the Smurfs Fruits Basket The Lovely Bones Jackass: The Movie Parsifal Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Poker jargon Ron Weasley One Tree Hill (TV series) Trailer Park Boys Sharon Tate Customs and etiquette of Japan The Critic AFI 100 Years series 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Catcher in the Rye Trapped in the Closet Have I Got News For You Hansel und Gretel The Ashlee Simpson Show Megan Griffin Milton H.
