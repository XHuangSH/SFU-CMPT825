do you think india is really economically growing strong or are we in a temporary money illusion the development so far we see is not from govt sector the govt especially state govts are doing their best to drag us behind with popular policies like free color tv or excessive reservation policy not only in studies it goes beyond till the employment probably death of the candidate i am not sure are we really developing in all fronts or there is something that we are really missing to catch up with let me start with a story that has nothing to do with india zhou enlai was once asked by a french journalist what he thought about the french revolution of zhou enlai said it is too soon to tell the same can be said about india there is no denying that the country is making enormous progress there is also no denying that the government policies are not particularly supportive of that progress the problem as i see it and being half world away i am not necessarily seeing it correctly is that there is still a very large percentage of indian population that makes a living by subsistence farming so whatever exciting stuff happens in bangalore or chennai it is of little benefit to the villagers who are still in the majority in india so in my opinion one area india needs to catch up on is bringing about major and positive change to the countryside having said that i must admit that i have no idea how this is to be done i simply do not know enough about the indian countryside Zhou Enlai Cultural Revolution India Famine Deng Xiaoping Chennai Hundred Flowers Campaign Xi'an Incident Economy of Africa Mao Zedong Open access Economy of Norway Chinese Civil War Wang Ming President of India Free trade Left-wing politics Sino-Soviet split Bangladesh Liberation War Bangalore Arturo Frondizi Economy of the United States Bob Rae Socialist economics Government of India Act 1935 Microeconomics Israeli Arab Tamil Nadu Education in India Henry Kissinger Liu Bocheng Mercantilism Affirmative action Constitution of India Tax Atal Bihari Vajpayee Shrimp farm People's Republic of China Economy of Nigeria Education Maharashtra South India Capitalism Globalization Education in the People's Republic of China History of socialism Freedom of speech History of the People's Republic of China Economy of Botswana Chiang Kai-shek Political economy Soviet Union Xiang Zhongfa Social Security debate (United States) Indira Gandhi History of communism New Deal Indian Round Table Conferences 1931-1933 Sino-Indian relations Li Peng Economic growth Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 History of the United States (1918-1945) Supply-side economics Liberalism Auto rickshaw History of the United States (1789-1849) Terrorism in Kashmir Unemployment Maoism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Communist Party of China Capital accumulation Common Agricultural Policy Trade Indian general elections, 2004 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on India Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Anarchism and capitalism Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia Economy of Russia 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Independence Party (Iceland) Economy of Pakistan Adivasi Nationalism K.
