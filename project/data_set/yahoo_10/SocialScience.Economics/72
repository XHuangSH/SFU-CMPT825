ringo loves playing rock and roll at high volume ringo loves playing rock and roll at high volume luciano loves opera and hates rock and roll unfortunately they are next door neighbors in an apartment building woth paper thin walls what is the externality here what command and control policy might the landlors impose could such a policy lead to an ineffiecient outcome in this scenario the rock and roll music is the externality in the form of a cost obviously ringo gets utility from playing rock music because he likes it and luciano pays a cost of having to listen to music he does not like the optimal social outcome is found when we are able to find the length of time of ringo playing his music where the difference between his utility and luciano's cost is greatest why is this a problem ringo has no economic incentives at the moment to care about the costs his music imposes on luciano and so will play music to the amount where his utility is maximized which will most assuredly be more than the socially optimal amount the landlord can impose one of essentially two policies in this scenario he can tax ringo for playing music or he can subsidize him the only way to have the socially optimal outcome is to tax ringo for his music playing the exact amount that luciano is cost for the music playing the simulated effect then is that ringo finds his optimal level of music playing as if he were paying the same cost as luciano any other tax or any subsidy will result in an inefficient outcome although certain taxes may result in a more efficient outcome than without any tax Microeconomics Externality Inflation Supply and demand Public good Privatization Progressive tax Tariff FairTax Monopsony Capitalism Welfare economics Free trade Corporate governance Health insurance Principal-agent problem Economic inequality Unemployment Model (economics) Subsidy Taxation in the United States Social cost Web crawler Alcohol fuel Agricultural policy Nuclear power CPU cache Minimum wage Economy of Russia Intellectual property Libertarian economic views E85 Environmental economics Economy of the United States Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Efficiency wages Keynesian economics Utilitarianism Economics Public transport Overpopulation Pigovian tax Labour economics Land use forecasting Supply-side economics East Germany Surplus value Public policy Gross domestic product Strategic management Opportunity cost Kyoto Protocol Law of value Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporate finance Economy of India The Beatles' influence Bureaucracy Political economy Variable universal life insurance Nuclear power phase-out Goodness and value theory Oil boom Criticisms of socialism Trade and development Solar cell Free market Wind power Deflation (economics) Capital accumulation Game theory Insurance Unemployment types Trade Global warming Neoclassical economics Compiler optimization Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia Labor-power Health care in the United States Future energy development Common Agricultural Policy Canadian and American economies compared Turbocharger Renewable energy development Social justice Fire fighting Optimization (computer science) Credit card History of Russia Education in the United States Utility Timpani Profit Behavioral finance
