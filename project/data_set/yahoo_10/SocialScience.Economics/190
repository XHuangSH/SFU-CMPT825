if america's economy is the biggest and strongest in the world why isn't the dollar the strongest currency in the world ok here's try the uk pound us 's to one the euro us 's to one the maltese pound us 's to one now is there anyone with a sensible answer i travel continuously and us 's used to be the currency to carry now it's the euro i am not interested in us bashing i was hoping for some elightenment on economics i am not american the american economy is the biggest without putting to many political spins on it it is certainly one of the strongest too then as in all types of markets the value of a currency is controlled by factors supply and demand direct and derived supply is controlled by all those people who print or lose the money demand is controlled by people that either want to own the 'the money' itself hold the promise of someone else and a small reward in exchange for not demanding delivery of that promise or for the promises underlying that 'money' i e things that people have made why is this money is just an iou for something desirable i clean your house and in exchange i want something back but not the copper that your company mines in utah so we exchange money at a 'price level' agreed and maintained by government so what makes the usd strong the relative supply of usd's to the relative 'things' measurable in usds and the reward for having usd's invested in them when compared to the relative supply of other ccys and the things that they represent that said the us economy's dollar is strong because the value of its production and the return including security of its investments is comparatively higher than other most other countries however the usd has recently fallen against most currencies either because an increase in printed money ie promises exchanged for no effort ie valueless promises which hasn't been the case as us inflation has been on par with most of the world or because the demand for high returns on investment and production elsewhere has comparatively increased so what does a weak strong currency indicate nothing much as long as it can be used as a conveniently divisible medium of exchange then the nominal value does not matter what does matter is a currency's comparative strength against its trading partners and their historical rates this is due to 'stickiness factors' of wages productivity etc which means that as a currency depreciates appreciates over a short period of time there is usually a significant lag in changes of output relative to the costs in input machinery bought at an earlier time will not cost less in the domestic currency weeks later even though the same amount of currency today may buy more or less machinery wages salaries are generally negotiated on an annual basis etc ie if you measure your own personal annual output in terms of snickers bars or portions of aston martins they all amount to the same thing in the end your salary you can consider it to be amd aston martin dollars or sbd snickers bar dollars your output is still chickens countries are just the same but they use currencies for convenience as not many of us produce only one thing and demand only one other exactly in sync with somebody elses production consumption requirements double coincidence of wants the exchange rate just measures how many chickens your friend in mexico is prepared to swap for your aston martin at an aggregate level rgds Supply-side economics Gold as an investment Surplus value Foreign exchange market Economy of India Pound sterling Balassa-Samuelson effect Capitalism Economy of Venezuela Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Capital accumulation Economy of Chile Law of value Economy of the United States Economy of Cuba Arbitrage Labor theory of value Economy of Pakistan Free trade Measures of national income and output Yield curve Commodity Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration Economy of Nigeria MMORPG Economy of Belgium Economic history of Spain Debt FairTax Currency Fiat money Interest Progressive tax Anarchism and capitalism Future energy development Tax Economy of the Philippines Economy of Suriname Renminbi Government debt Economy of Romania Tariff Economy of Germany Australian dollar Political economy Heckscher-Ohlin model Economy of Norway Economic relations of Japan Derivative (finance) Economy of Guyana Unemployment Capital controversy Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economy of Peru Privatization Mutual fund Say's law Economy of Brazil Economy of Sweden Economy of Europe Devaluation Hard currency Trade Economy of Colombia Labor-power Economy of Uzbekistan Wealth Purchasing power parity Model (economics) Economy of South Africa Principal-agent problem
