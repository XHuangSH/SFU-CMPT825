impact on software proffesionals due to the rupee rise in india hi what will appen to the people working in big companies like ibm intel etc are they going to loose the job the initial impetus for the outsourcing of jobs to india was because of the high level of education of workers the fact that most spoke english and the fact that they were much less expensive than american software engineers there are a couple of factors that are slowing down the outsourcing trend now first of all as you mentioned the indian rupee is appreciating against the dollar this reduces the benefit software companies get when they can pay employees in rupees instead of dollars second of all and probably more importantly indian workers are demanding higher wages there are only a limited number of software engineers india can produce every year and as more companies come to depend on them the cost of their services gets bid up they are still much cheaper than u s software engineers but the gap is closing the third factor is that u s firms are realizing that outsourcing all of their functions offshore is not always the right move dell for example had to bring their corporate technical support back to the united states after they got complaints from their customers there is also the time difference to consider companies don't like to have to wait an entire day to resolve issues because it's night in india and everyone is asleep i do not think that in the end indians who are already employed will lose their jobs due to any of the factors i have mentioned above what will happen is that fewer jobs will be moved to india in the future as u s companies rationalize their operations the wages of indians won't be as high as if the exchange rate of the rupee had remained constant against the dollar but there will still be jobs Call centre Economic inequality Economy of India Minimum wage Inflation Microsoft Free trade Wal-Mart Labour economics Economy of Russia Trade union Monetary policy Unemployment Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Natural monopoly International Computers Ltd CPU cache CPU design Insurance Microeconomics Arbitrage Efficiency wages Redundant array of independent disks Offshore outsourcing Celtic Tiger Indian general elections, 2004 RISC Health insurance Mainframe computer IBM Software engineering Working time Tariff Supply and demand Mutual fund Labor theory of value Capital accumulation Indian Rupee Principal-agent problem Academic publishing IBM PC compatible Progressive tax Compiler optimization Economy of Sri Lanka Price discrimination Social Security (United States) Canadian and American economies compared Education in the People's Republic of China Flat tax Information Technology Infrastructure Library Central processing unit Sweatshop Intel Strategic management Voter turnout Electrical engineering Rational Unified Process Life insurance Digital photography Wind power Asian financial crisis Keynesian economics Temasek Holdings AMD Deflation (economics) Shrimp farm Customer relationship management Taxation in the United States Affirmative action Reliability engineering Xerox 401(k) Economic history of Japan Monopsony Social Security debate (United States) Tax Canadian and American health care systems compared FairTax Airline Tata Consultancy Services Apple Macintosh Immigration to the United States Freeters Balassa-Samuelson effect Yield curve Demographics of Japan Microcredit Jet engine Pentium 4
