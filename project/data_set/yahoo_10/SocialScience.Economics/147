what are some factors that cause the us dollar to rise against most other currencies especially the euro does the us dollar generally rise against other currency's when the stock market tanks i noticed that the us dollar rose against the euro today at the same time the stock market indexes dropped does this mean that investors are keeping their money in cash or buying usd when they are pulling out of stocks i'm quite new to all this and trying to learn it seems that the usd can become stronger when the fed increases the interest rates but what are some other factors that could cause it to fluctuate on a daily or weekly basis finally what direction do you think it's going over the next few weeks months and years generally when the interest rate rises the currency appreciates speculators will try to buy assets with the higher interest rate and to do so they will need to buy the domestic currency this increase the demand for the currency causing it to appreciate ie its price increases the stock market tends to go down when interest rates go up as it makes borrowing more costly for firms and future profits have to be discounted more what causes the daily fluctuations well a lot of it is speculations and people and firms will have changing needs for foreign currency depending on international trade these changes in demand and supply of currency and so the price of a currency relative to another another factor to take into account is inflation if inflation is higher in one country its currency may depreciate nominally to keep things balanced in real terms i also suggest that you google a term called uncovered interest parity most fluctuations are down to it maybe google dornbusch overshooting as well my opinion is mixed inflation is still a worry in the uk and europe and so interest rates may have to rise here the sub prime crisis is drying up liquidity although the crisis is having a global impact it has affected the us the most and so the fed may be reluctant to raise rates at the moment furthermore if confidence is severely affected there might be a flight to bonds particularly us treasury bonds causing a appreciation on the other hand central banks are resorting to injecting reserves which can have the effect of diluting strength sorry this is confusing but the sub prime problems have made things very unpredictable at the moment my guess is that in the long term the dollar will have to depreciate further much research indicates that a random walk does a better job of predicting currency fluctuations that most macroeconomic models the exception to this is when you have information over flow which professional traders handling the big orders will do but the amateur will not Keynesian economics Money Pound sterling Gold as an investment Interest Federal Reserve Fiat money Derivative (finance) Government debt Futures contract Economy of India Law of value Bank Short selling Economy of Sri Lanka Central bank Model (economics) Supply and demand Economics Mutual fund Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Corporate finance Financial markets Economy of the United States Capitalism Free trade Economy of Africa Economy of Venezuela Great Depression Technical analysis U.S. public debt Devaluation Reaganomics Economy of Nigeria Rational pricing Economy of Brazil Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Security (finance) Mergers and acquisitions Stock market PE ratio Economy of Europe Australian dollar Speculation Finance Currency Enron Corporation Economy of the United Kingdom Social Security debate (United States) Ford Motor Company 1973 oil crisis Citigroup Economy of Argentina Business cycle Rational expectations Commodity markets Tariff History of the United States (1918-1945) MMORPG Economic relations of Japan Real (currency) Black Wednesday Economy of Cuba Purchasing power parity Mortgage Stock
