is it possible to calculate if the production and consumption of something is socially efficient hi i am an international student from south america im in high school taking ib economics hl is it possible to calculate if the production and consumption of something is socially efficient if it is what is it that i need thanks ps if you have further ideas for an essay to turn in next week it should be about a topic given in ib econ hl and shoud imply an investigation please list them thanks i'm talking about externalities can someone calculate externalities or is it just theory i mean in the ib book there are some graphs how do i put values into that graphs is it possible or are they just models thanks generally especially in international baccalaureate level text books they won't give ask you to calculate formula for the social consumption production vs private consumption production levels they do as you say just list illustrative graphs and if your lecturer examiner is very keen they will label points and ask you to describe areas according to such labels and where taxes and subsidies might be appropriate and the associated dead weight loss the idea is to get you to visualise the idea that while you might like to do something say graffiti there are costs involved to others and that there is an economic ie non normative argument for society to intervene ie the government to stop people from painting stuff that isn t theirs of course this extends into stuff where there is no established property ie what right do you have to sit in a front row of a free concert or to consume public healthcare over the next person but for now stick with pollution and protection deterrence of police forces defence force and public transport mention free riders people who consume non rival public goods without paying their fair share moral hazard when people make decisions based around their own private utility not considering the full impact pertaining to insurance risk particularly and you will be fine moving into university or at least undergraduate university they will expect you to be able to derive a simple formula for social benefit or just give you a co efficient to work with linear enough curves that said the real world calculation of 'externalities' is a pretty tricky endeavour you'll probably find that your book next refers to a guy called coase who basically argued that it didn't matter whether the externality was applied to the producer of the consumer of the externality it's not an exact science yet hence the global warming issue and so many lawyers o Free trade Inflation Public good Supply and demand Gross domestic product Tax Political economy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capitalism Welfare economics Unemployment Organic farming Free market Law of value Capital accumulation Economic inequality Publicly funded medicine Labor theory of value Mathematics Ethics Tariff Insurance Subsidy Liberalism Social justice Neoclassical economics Philosophy of business Health insurance Economy of the United States Public policy Supply-side economics Market failure Progressive tax Opportunity cost Nuclear power phase-out Theory of conduct Surplus product Utility Transformation problem Goodness and value theory Anarchist economics Wind power Nuclear power Property (ownership right) Prisoner's dilemma Austrian School Annuity Productive and unproductive labour Extreme Programming ELO rating system Surplus value GED Alcohol fuel Natural monopoly Energy development Graph (mathematics) Democracy Polynomial State Trigonometric function The Skeptical Environmentalist Kyoto Protocol Non-aggression principle Fair trade Deflation (economics) American individualist anarchism Anarchism and capitalism Economy of India Anarcho-capitalism Behavioral finance Calculus Efficiency wages Criticisms of socialism Unemployment benefit Criticism of libertarianism Wealth Vector (spatial) Land use forecasting Globalization Libertarianism Advertising Commodity markets Socialist economics Coercion Complex number
