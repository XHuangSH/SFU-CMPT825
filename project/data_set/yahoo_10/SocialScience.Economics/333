the rich keeps getting richer and the poor just keeps getting poorer my question is how can the poor get out of this cycle and start moving into the average sides of things middle class and beyond the poor guy's way of thinking is rooted in the deeply ingrained belief that they do not deserve prosperity they do not deserve better so it is easier to complain and find excuses to justify being poor it is easy to say they are discriminated against or any other lame excuse especially when they want great earnings in exchange for very little work out of two guys working in the same office doing the same job if one goes the extra mile stays late to help sometimes enrolls in optional training courses offered by the company while the other one who leaves at pm sharp because they do not get paid overtime or refuses to take additional training is the first to complain when overlooked for promotions raises or bonuses poor people expect others to help them especially if others have more money than they do think poor and you will remain poor instead of slaving away for a minimum wage find a creative way to earn money yes it involves work but if you find a way eventually you will have more time and more money poor people tend to repeat the same patterns that kept their parents poor they tend to repeat the same mistakes and stay in the same place they need to break out of that noxious environment girls in slums for example most of them expect to have an abusive father or other male relatives they expect probable sexual abuse by their relatives or boyfriends they expect repeated teen pregnancies they expect an irresponsible and absent biological father in each case they expect the fact that they will probably not finish high school and that they will end up working in a fast food joint or as prostitutes or whatever as long as this information does not change they are well programmed and headed in that direction we are deserving of so many things we just don't dare believe it is true or possible Economic inequality Capitalism Infantilism Education in the People's Republic of China Flat tax Minimum wage Friends Domestic violence EastEnders Capital accumulation Microeconomics Abortion debate Simone Weil Make money fast Public policy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Days of our Lives Keynesian economics The Amazing Race Wealth Principal-agent problem Rape Poker jargon Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Poverty Anorexia nervosa Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Economy of Africa Affirmative action Prisoner's dilemma Alexander Technique Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Wealth condensation Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Arbitrage Anarchism and capitalism Tax Craps Technical analysis Wal-Mart The O.C.
