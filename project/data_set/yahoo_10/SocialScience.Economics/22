as the rich get richer does that necessarily mean that the poor and middle class get poorer from econ governments and banks must limit the amount of in circulation because the more there is the less it's worth so if we have more millionaires becoming billionaires aren't they are taking bigger slices of the same pie put another way if a company pays a ceo bonus out of its profits then employees don't get bonus whether or not their work was necessary to produce the profit or let's say bill gates gets profit for every sale of a software package he earns but million people then have less and in a few years will probably have to spend it again to upgrade as it becomes obsolete maybe bill gates was a bad example i certainly didn't mean to imply that there's something wrong with buying the powerful software but will it put food on the family as a certain politico would say if i bought million worth of software and didn't have enough left over to buy food and pay the rent would i still be wealthy i think you should move onto econ the whole money economic pie idea is a joke let me give you a scenario if you have a millionaire in your community that was also philanthropic and gave money to the schools churches etc and that also sat in on boards of economic development or what have you for that particular city does he she take from the pie at that point or is he she making more pies for the money to redistribute itself now let's look at the concept of being paid what you design it's called a right to ownership this also applies to owners of a corporation such as bill gates he may not be the sole designer of all the microsoft products anymore but he still owns the producing corporation all of it's factories and so forth so the concept is the same what you create or what you own you should be paid for that's what free enterprise is about i find it to be interesting how it's always employees that reference the infernal pie economic scale as a means to supplant the wealthy and how entrepeneurs always understand that there is no pie but there are bakeries for lack of a better word though i truly can understand where you're coming from with this i used to despise the wealthy it's one of those things that happens with you grow up in a common'wealth' and all of it's political corruption with primo examples of wealthy and dirt broke with no middle class and used this pie example all the time now that i've been educated on how real economics and free enterprise actually works through working directly with millionaires i understand that all the rhetoric and theory my business and economics profressor's taught me in college just simply isn't true Microeconomics Wealth Economic inequality Anarchism and capitalism Flat tax Surplus value American individualist anarchism Tax Public policy Productive and unproductive labour Gross domestic product Wealth condensation Privatization Intellectual property Inflation Labor theory of value Bill Gates Stock Amway Microsoft Socialist economics Commodity FairTax Ashton-Tate Socialism Law of value Karl Marx Political economy Property (ownership right) Copyleft Primitive accumulation of capital Criticisms of socialism Ownership Andrew Carnegie Keynesian economics Democracy Wheel of Fortune George Soros Enron Corporation Free trade Unemployment Criticism of libertarianism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance SCO-Linux controversies Warren Buffett Monopoly (game) Trickle down effect CPU design Millionaire New Deal W.
