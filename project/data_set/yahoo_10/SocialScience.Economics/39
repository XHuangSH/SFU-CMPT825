for the following cost function tc q q marginal cost is the change in total cost that arises when the quantity produced changes by one unit mathematically the marginal cost mc function is expressed as the derivative of the total cost tc function with respect to quantity q note that the marginal cost may change with volume and so at each level of production the marginal cost is the cost of the next unit produced mc dtc dq in the present case tc q q dtc dq q mc q Marginal cost Production theory basics Labour economics Transformation problem Profit maximization Cournot competition Supply and demand Microeconomics Production function Monopoly Economics Derivative Stackelberg competition Partition function (statistical mechanics) Law of value Production, costs, and pricing Bertrand competition Diminishing returns Prices of production Vector (spatial) Labor theory of value Natural monopoly Welfare economics Monopsony Function (mathematics) Marginalism Externality Tax Calculus Mathematics Production possibility frontier Capital controversy Public good Classical mechanics Force Navier-Stokes equations Maxwell's equations Break even analysis Monetary policy Heat equation Lebesgue integration Neoclassical economics Derivation of the partition function Hilbert space Tsiolkovsky rocket equation Progressive tax Dimensional analysis Statistical mechanics Thermodynamics Tensor Exchange value Diamond Model (economics) Economic calculation problem Infinity Riemann zeta function Formal power series Dynamical system Bayesian inference Opportunity cost Digital circuit Price Returns to scale Productive and unproductive labour Austrian School PID controller Labor-power Trigonometric function Free trade Units of measurement Principal-agent problem Monopolistic competition Noether's theorem Flux Appeal William Stanley Jevons Exponentiation Social cost Input-output model Normal distribution Lie derivative Theory of the firm Anarchism and capitalism Multiple integral Tone (linguistics) Explosive material Bayes' theorem Inflation Action (physics) Trip distribution Bessel function Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Laplace operator Exponential growth Ricci flow Principle of maximum entropy Nondimensionalization Heim theory Quaternion
