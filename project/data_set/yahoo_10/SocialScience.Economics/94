what is consumer awareness india consumer awareness in india the consumer movement in india is as old as trade and commerce in kautilya's arthashastra there are references to the concept of consumer protection against exploitation by the trade and industry short weighment and measures adulteration and punishment for these offences however there was no organised and systematic movement actually safeguarding the interests of the consumers prior to independence the main laws under which the consumer interests were considered were the indian penal code agricultural production grading and marketing act drugs and cosmetics act even though different parts of india exhibited different levels of awareness in general the level of awareness was pretty low an average indian consumer is noted for his patience and tolerance perhaps because of these two traditional traits and due to the influence of the mahabharata the ramayana and the bhagavad gita he considers the receipt of defective goods and services as an act of fate or unfavourable planetary position in his horoscope when a new television or refrigerator purchased by him turns out to be defective from day one he takes it reticently blaming it on his fate or as the consequence of the wrongs committed by him in his previous birth very often he is exploited put to avoidable inconveniences and suffers financial loss it is rather paradoxical that the customer is advertised as the king by the seller and service provider but in actual practice treated as a slave or servant goods are purchased by him along with the label items once sold by us will never be received back under any circumstances whatsoever this unethical illegal and unilateral declaration has to be viewed in the light of the practice in developed countries where the seller declares in case you are not fully satisfied with our product you can bring the same to us within a month for either replacement or return of your money this will clearly indicate the level of consumer consciousness however things are changing slowly but steadily and the momentum has increased considerably since the establishment of consumer courts and due to the efforts of a number of consumer organisations and the media the next millennium will witness a high degree of consumer awareness and the concepts of comparative costs consumer preference resistance abstinence and consumer choice will become vital aspects of the economy an analysis of the data from the consumer courts in different states shows that there is a direct relationship between literacy and consumer awareness statistics relating to kerala and bihar will justify this the question to be considered is what can the government do to improve the position Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economics Capitalism Economy of India Inflation Gross domestic product Intellectual property Free trade Tax Trade union Contract Trademark Ethical consumerism History of the United States (1918-1945) Appeal Supply and demand Prices of production Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Advertising Monopoly Abortion debate Vegetarianism Privatization Democracy Illegal drug trade Economy of Russia Famine Coercion Labor theory of value United Kingdom corporation tax Credit card Technical analysis Divorce FairTax Food and Drug Administration Mahatma Gandhi Simone Weil India Short selling Internet fraud History of the United States Hinduism Economy of Pakistan Liberalism Tariff Capital punishment First Amendment to the United States Constitution Crime Arturo Frondizi Constitution of Ireland Law of value Surplus product Relationship marketing Keynesian economics Publicly funded medicine Ramayana Anarchism and capitalism Arguments for and against drug prohibition Balassa-Samuelson effect Ecology Political economy History of South Africa in the apartheid era Capital accumulation Productive and unproductive labour Fair trade Ottoman Empire Government of India Act 1935 School of Salamanca Plame affair Freedom of speech Gold standard Supply-side economics Kyoto Protocol Lawrence v.
