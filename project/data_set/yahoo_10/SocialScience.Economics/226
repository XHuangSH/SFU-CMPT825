the federal reserve is facing a huge problem what will they do if the federal reserve fails to increase interest rates inflation devaluation of dollar will occur and if they do increase rates a recession will occur neither is good for americans what do you think they will do your question gets right to the heart of the delicate balancing act that is monetary policy in fact their mission statement includes conducting the nation s monetary policy in pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices exactly how and when to raise interest rates is an ongoing debate among economists in a perfect interest rate setting scenario the reason for rising prices is soley due to a threat of an overheating economy too much money so the fed should just tweak the interest upward anytime you see massive speculation rising prices e g housing stocks that is usually a sign of too much money but prices can rise for other legitimate reasons like political unrest e g middle east raw material shortages e g steel cartels e g oil disasters e g katrina in these cases prices are rising for reasons other than too much money in fact these rising prices will actually put a drag of their own on the economy so what to do if there are legitimate non monetary reasons for rising prices the fed should let it run it's course and for the economy to adjust if there is speculation behind rising prices the fed should do a little jaw boning to get it under control show concern express interest rates may rise etc be on guard of inflation bias this is a situation where consumers and businesses don't change behaviors in response to rising prices and just pass it on this happened in the s when this happens where labor and business contracts have built in cpi price increases higher inflation becomes ingrained and is difficult to tame without a major shock remember the recession if the fed sees evidence of inflation bias creeping in then a tighter money supply is almost mandatory unfortunately adjusting interest rates based on national averages is a shot gun approach half the country will be above the average unemployment half below so the interest rate change will be too high for half the country and too low for the other half this is where fiscal policy can help by shifting government spending to under performing areas and away from over performing areas but it is unlikely politicians would take such an even handed approach they are all after what's best for their districts and rich districts tend to have more political pull and more pork this perpetuates a lopsided economy of winners and losers but now we're getting into political issues which is outside the scope of your question Capitalism Economy of Venezuela Economics Economy of Pakistan 1973 oil crisis Arthur Laffer Deficit spending Unemployment Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money supply Gross domestic product Great Depression Phillips curve History of the United States (1964-1980) Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 History of the United States (1980-1988) Economy of Nigeria Economy of Africa Economy of Belgium Privatization Free trade Economy of India Economic history of Spain Labour economics Economic relations of Japan Federal Reserve Say's law Argentine Currency Board Business cycle Hubbert peak theory Tariff History of the United States (1918-1945) Capital accumulation FairTax U.S. public debt Consumer price index Law of value Central bank Economy of the Netherlands Economy of Ghana Economic history of the United States New Deal Model (economics) Money Economy of Romania Stagflation Social Security (United States) Fiat money Economy of Sri Lanka Canadian and American economies compared Minimum wage Economy of Suriname Economy of Colombia International Monetary Fund United States dollar Government debt Economy of Brazil Balassa-Samuelson effect Economy of Chile Energy crisis Neo-Keynesian Economics Economy of the Czech Republic Marshall Plan Labor theory of value Divorce Wealth Economy of Haiti Overpopulation Economy of Sweden Pound sterling George W.
