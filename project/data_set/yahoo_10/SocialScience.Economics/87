do unions just make things cost more for everyone this is somewhat of a tricky question because it depends on which side of the fence you are viewing it from unions have done a lot to improve working conditions and raise wages but most generally this does cause prices to increase because there is not a corresponding increase in production for a simple example if one person can produce one product in an hour for which he is paid an hour the company basis their price of the product on that cost plus other operating expenses if the union now comes along and say the production person must be paid and hour the money to pay the worker must come from someplace perhaps the company can cut some expenses elsewhere or lay off another worker to offset the increase if so then price of the product would not go up if not then we pay more this is a real tough question but another question is the long term effect unions have on the economy if businesses feel they can not meet the demands some bad things can happen the business can close they can ship the jobs out of the country they can import workers from other countries or they can automate more and replace workers with machines we have seen a lot of this with mining steel railroads auto makers and air lines as a few examples however we can not always blame the unions because there may be other factors involved as well the simple answer is more pay for the same production does generally equal higher prices but there is not always a simple answer to this Labor theory of value Microeconomics Tax Tariff Deflation (economics) Keynesian economics Inflation Minimum wage Supply and demand Gross domestic product Unemployment Economics Trade union Hyperinflation Wal-Mart Privatization Capitalism Free trade Outsourcing Principal-agent problem Labor-power Progressive tax Economic inequality Monetary policy Law of value Labour economics Anarchism and capitalism Economy of Russia Call centre Welding Commodity Model (economics) Balassa-Samuelson effect Mutual fund Offshoring Sweatshop Efficiency wages Monopsony Political economy Health insurance Productive and unproductive labour Opportunity cost Social Credit Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Great Depression Price discrimination Industrial Revolution Monopoly Ford Motor Company Life insurance Surplus labour Economy of the United States Canadian and American economies compared Arbitrage Graduate school FairTax Industrial engineering Supply-side economics Economic growth New Deal Gold standard Nuclear power Commodore International Criticisms of socialism Economy of India 1973 oil crisis Airline Eight hour day Hydrogen economy General equilibrium Kyoto Protocol Transformation problem Externality Corporate finance Extreme Programming Energy development Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment types Future energy development Technocratic movement Education in the People's Republic of China Social Security (United States) Working time Wealth Congress of Industrial Organizations Compensation of employees History of the United States (1865-1918) Subsidy Social Security debate (United States) Value added tax Taxation in the United States Personal rapid transit
