how does comparative advantage exist today another question i dont get comparative advantage ricardo's principle relies on a variety of implicit assumptions that are debatable such as that there is no or a low cost for transportation and that the advantages of increased production outweigh externalities such as environmental contamination or social inequities opponents of free trade often point out that globalized communications and transportation unavailable in ricardo's time invalidate the assumption of capital immobility and cause capital to gravitate toward absolute advantage though proponents would point out that modern low cost transportation only makes the assumption more sound it has also been argued that comparative advantage may reduce economic diversity to risky levels free trade advocates would dissent however and say that modernization has decreased transportation and logistics costs through inventions such as the airplane or the internet which were unavailable in ricardo's time making his theory ever increasingly sound furthermore despite the increased movement of capital differences in capacities of production are still wide in fact free trade creates a wider gap of production in many areas despite the larger increases it makes in absolute wealth in theory as long as a country has one more worker one more machine or one extra source of natural resources comparative advantage will still apply as to perfect competition supporters of free trade claim that perfect competition is the result of universal free trade not its precondition for free trade advocates comparative advantage is what a capitalist country must embrace to gain an advantage in an existing mercantilist world on a final note gottfried haberler showed in the s that ricardo's thinking on comparative advantage could also be expressed in neoclassical terms of opportunity cost Economics Law of value Political economy Microeconomics Economic inequality Liberalism Labor theory of value Intellectual property Neoclassical economics Supply and demand Wealth Economic growth Model (economics) Heckscher-Ohlin model Balassa-Samuelson effect Left-wing politics Democracy Sociocultural evolution Organic farming Postmodernism Trade Keynesian economics Capital accumulation American individualist anarchism Goodness and value theory Comparative advantage Prices of production History of economic thought Minimum wage Socialism Free market Inflation Neoliberalism Publicly funded medicine Privatization Strategic management Productive and unproductive labour Anarchist economics FairTax Supply-side economics Libertarianism Mercantilism Growth theory Exploitation Monopoly World government Unemployment Adam Smith Division of labour Ethics Criticisms of socialism Petroleum Austrian School Transformation problem Anarchism and capitalism Energy development Tariff Criticism of libertarianism Gross domestic product Economy of Africa The Wealth of Nations Biodiversity Technocratic movement Surplus product Fair trade Anarchism and society Progressive tax Culture Determinism Marginalism Voter turnout Conservatism Economic history of Britain Affirmative action David Ricardo Intellectual capital Surplus value Commodity markets Cultural relativism Anti-globalization Socialist economics Overpopulation Labour economics Freedom of speech CPU cache Anarchism Economy of Norway Trade union Non-aggression principle
