how does the median voter theory affect economics on a micro level what economic expectations an informed voter should have we must know what is medoan voter theory if at all it may affect politics and political economy and not economics proper median voter theory also known as the median voter theorem and the median voter model is a famous voting model positing that in a majority election if voter policy preferences can be represented along one dimension i e if every voter's political ideology can be pinpointed on a line and preferences are normally distributed if a voter always votes for the politician that commits to a policy position closest to their own preference and if there are only two politicians then if the politicians want to maximize their number of votes and are prepared to choose policies purely to achieve this they should both commit to the policy position preferred by the median voter this politician strategy is the nash equilibrium of the game see game theory it results in both politicians receiving half the votes and if either candidate deviates to commit to a different policy position the deviating candidate receives less than half the vote the theorem was first articulated in duncan black's article on the rationale of group decision making and popularized by anthony downs's book an economic theory of democracy earlier thinkers such as condorcet and harold hotelling hinted at similar formulations although hotelling's model in his paper stability in competition had a huge mathematical mistake its main idea that politicians would compete to be the most middle of the road was adopted as other models with the same thesis were invented but did not receive widespread recognition for the identification of this simple idea that is nonetheless easily observed in modern elections the median voter theoery have implications for micro economics like when a product's product provision entails fixed costs it will be made available only if a sufficient number of people want it some products are produced and consumed locally so that provision requires not only a large group favoring the product but a large number nearby just as one has an incentive to sort into community whose median voter shares his preferences for local public goods product markets may provide an analogous incentive to sort into a community whose consumers tend to share his preferences in private goods using zip code level data on chain restaurants and restaurants overall this paper documents how the mix of locally available restaurants responds to the local mix of consumers with three findings first based on survey data on chain restaurant patronage restaurant preferences differ substantially by race and education second there is a strong relationship between restaurants and population at the zip code level suggesting that restaurants geographic markets are small finally the mix of locally available chain restaurants is sensitive to the zipcode demographic mix by race and by education hence differentiated product markets provide a benefit proximity to preferred restaurants to persons in geographic markets whose customers tend to share their preferences the median voter theory has also implications for public economic policy choices like setting tariffs on international trade public choice theory is simply economics applied to a market with peculiar property rights just as in the economic analysis of an ordinary market individuals are assumed to pursue their separate objectives rationally just as in that analysis one may first make and later drop simplifying assumptions such as perfect information or zero transaction costs the property rights on the public market however are different from those on the private market they include the right of individuals to vote for representatives of representatives to make laws of government officials to enforce the laws of judges to interpret them and so on one of the ways in which different public choice theories differ from each other is in what they take to be the equivalent of the firm on the political market and what it is assumed to maximize consider the entrepreneurs on the political market to be elected politicians and limit my discussion to the market for legislation this is a simplification of the political market and only one of several possible simplifications but it provides
