how much does time cost per minute how much does time cost per minute i heard the saying time is money so i was wondering how much it really was calculated and stuff how many dollars or cents per minute on average like from birth to death and from the count of rich and poor people etc how much is time per minute this old saying is based on opportunity cost everyone's time is worth something different and there is no actual gauge of what it is generally if you're willing to go to work for a specific wage you are estimating that you can't get a better deal on your time so you show up if you are bill gates your time is very valuable since you can be doing things that generate lots of income if you are a bum on the street your time is not very valuable since no one will pay you much for it if you made a year then you think your time is worth less than per hour based on a hour work year otherwise you would be unwilling to work for someone else since your best alternative would make you more please note that this only applies to time in monetary terms if you were dying how much would you give for another few hours with your family the value of time is very subjective and can't be accurately computed your wages act as a decent estimate though since they are greater than the value that you would place on your own time Economic inequality Microeconomics Inflation Blackjack Hyperinflation Minimum wage Gross domestic product Taxation in the United States Capital accumulation United States dollar Labour economics Opportunity cost Economics Progressive tax Supply and demand Unemployment FairTax Life insurance Flat tax Capitalism Surplus value Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Money Insurance PE ratio Labor theory of value Anarchism and capitalism Fuel injection Poker jargon Ra (board game) Law of value Tax protester Trip distribution Welfare trap Social Security (United States) Canadian dollar Economy of Russia New Deal Public domain Annuity ELO rating system Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Goodness and value theory Doomsday argument Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Live 8 Corporate finance Consumer price index Estoppel Gold standard Gauge theory Public policy Bay Area Rapid Transit Tide Interest Personal finance Make money fast Conscription Act of Parliament Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Property tax Mode choice United Kingdom corporation tax Education in Romania Welfare economics Contract Betting (poker) Wage Depreciation Trade union Wal-Mart Arthur Laffer Transformation problem Supply-side economics Social Security debate (United States) Euro Donald Trump Food Stamp Program Rich Mullins San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Philippine peso Education in the People's Republic of China Legal tender English plural Publicly funded medicine Julian day British national identity card Sweatshop Austrian School Credit card Unemployment benefit Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals) Light rail Principal-agent problem Hipparchus (astronomer) New Zealand dollar Wealth condensation
