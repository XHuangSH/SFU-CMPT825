why does capitalism fail why does communism fail what was called 'communism' was nothing more than state capitalism in other words the transfer of the means of production from the capitalist class to a state bureaucracy did not result in the workers control of the means of production hence the exploitation of labor persisted albeit in a heavily regulated centrally planned state so this leads to just one question 'why does capitalism fail' according to marx increased investment in and growth of constant capital factories machines land buildings raw materials relative to variable capital labor reduced the margin of surplus labor time with respect to total capital constant capital plus variable capital since surplus labor time is the source of surplus value and since profit equals surplus value divided by total capital then the tendential fall in surplus labor time relative to total capital results in a tendential fall in the rate of profit mathematically marx put it as follows since p s c and c c v where p rate of profit s surplus value c constant capital and v variable capital then an increase in c relative to v means an increase in c relative to s which means a decrease in p even as investment in constant capital increases productivity i e the margin of surplus labor relative to regular labor and thus of surplus value relative to variable capital it reduces profits i e the margin of surplus value relative to total capital the capitalist then responds by investing more in raising productivity which in turn reduces profits further and so on and so forth in a vicious cycle of diminishing returns this tendency eventually leads to a catastrophic breakdown in the capital cycle of course one can stave of these crisis by imperialism imperialism produces fresh influxes of profits now a days this influx is produced by combination of forcing odious debts upon third world counties by lending to corrupt dictators who keep the money but the debt is transferred to the population engineering favorable conditions to the industrial capitalists of third world economies through neoliberal trade policies and some new school what i call fake facade imperialism like in iraq Economy of Russia Inflation Capital accumulation Constant capital Microeconomics Karl Marx Law of value Marxism Labor-power Bretton Woods system Prices of production Transformation problem Commodity Economy of Pakistan Tariff Economic relations of Japan Organic composition of capital Socialist economics Deflation (economics) Economy of Norway Industrial Revolution Unemployment Political economy Tax Surplus labour Primitive accumulation of capital Economic growth Globalization Production theory basics Capitalist mode of production Marshall Plan Economy of the United States Gross domestic product Economic inequality Class struggle American individualist anarchism Economy of Africa Socialism Progressive tax Productive and unproductive labour Wealth Economics Value product Business cycle Economy of India Supply-side economics History of the Soviet Union Economic history of Spain Monopsony Exogenous growth model Privatization Production function Economy of the People's Republic of China Gold standard Growth theory Economic history of Britain Economy of Taiwan Monopoly Hyperinflation Supply and demand Anti-communism Exploitation Economic calculation problem Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Great Depression Economic history of Japan Economy of Venezuela Neoliberalism Argentine Currency Board Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia History of economic thought Rise of the New Imperialism Virtuous circle and vicious circle Social Security debate (United States) Libertarian socialism Bank Economy of Chile Anti-globalization Economy of Colombia Deficit spending Corporate finance Free market Minimum wage Economy of Brazil Working time
