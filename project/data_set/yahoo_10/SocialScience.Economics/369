would the only way to end poverty in the united states and beyond be the following to limit the salary of the higest paid employee owner to x the salary of thier lowest paid employee the rich could still stay rich and i'm not saying they don't earn it and there is no limit to how rich they could get the only thing that would limit that is how well thier company is doing and the whole country would be in a better place all round if everyone had a piece of the pie that the elite have and notice i said salarys not company profit the companies would not go bankrupt nor would the c e o s but the ceo's would have less but by no means nothing they just couldn't go out and buy the mona lisa as long as thier employees couldn't afford the gas is it the only way probably not is it a good way probably many of the answerers cringed at the idea of limiting incomes and its effect on incentives and on hard work however much of this country's growth occurred when we in fact had lower employee owner ratios i think in the 's when a average income family could often afford to live with one bread winner and it was not impossible for them to also purchase a home the ratio was much smaller than it was today possibly smaller than what you are suggesting people should be rewarded for hard work but oddly enough that should not be only criteria if you want a healthy economy it is important to have a large middle class to to be able to afford all those things that capitalists make and many of today's billionaires a point made famously by warren buffet end up giving their money to charity or arguing that people like him should pay more taxes it is hard to imagine that someone like warren buffet would work less hard if some of the money that he donated to charity would be taxed away or given to his employees Microeconomics Capitalism Progressive tax Flat tax Economic inequality Capital accumulation Mutual fund Tax Anarchism and capitalism Warren Buffett Ownership Wealth condensation Minimum wage Inflation Salary cap FairTax Stock Deflation (economics) Surplus value Health insurance Taxation in the United States Reaganomics Unemployment Criticisms of socialism National Kidney Foundation Singapore Free trade Insurance Tax cut Wealth 401(k) Supply-side economics Supply and demand Donald Trump Money Gold standard Annuity Investment bank Outsourcing Intellectual property Life insurance Steve Jobs Public policy Economy of Russia Live 8 Publicly funded medicine Economy of Africa Keynesian economics Credit card Poker jargon Economy of the United States Principal-agent problem Working time Mergers and acquisitions Airline Compensation of employees Instant-runoff voting Kyoto Protocol Great Depression Labor-power Economics Google Offshoring United Kingdom corporation tax Commodity Tax bracket Paradox PE ratio Unemployment benefit Debt Canadian and American health care systems compared Surplus labour Say's law Monetary policy Trade Arthur Laffer Final Fantasy XI Primitive accumulation of capital Enron Corporation Labour economics Wheel of Fortune Tuition Capitalist mode of production Article One of the United States Constitution Social class Sweatshop Economy of India Serfdom
