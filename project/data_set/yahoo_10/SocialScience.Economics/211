im going to marry an african guy from ghana anyone have any advice for me marrying someone from a different culture is very difficult so make sure you are both defining your roles in the relationship and ultimate goals on the same terms my father was mexican american and married a woman from mexico dad's parents came from mexico so he knew a lot about mexican culture but even with that there were adjustments mom came from northern mexico and dad's parents from southern mexico there were issues i'm american raised in the mid west and married an american raised in the south ouch i thought we had the same expectations and goals but was i wrong i'm now divorced there's all kinds of things finances religion child rearing who does what chores around the house tons of stuff that you may think you know how he's going to handle but that you don't for example my ex never set appropriate boundaries for his witch of a mother can you believe he even discussed our birth control with her and she had the gall to tell me to switch to the method that she had used which if i'd been stupid enough to listen would have no doubt given her the grandkids she so desperately wanted there's tons of stuff you need to be aware of more than i can cover in this format but i wish you the best of luck Laura Schlessinger Father Fathers' rights Calvin and Hobbes Abortion debate Family Social rule Satchel Paige Polyamory Divorce Charmed Hey Jude Mediation Friends Transsexuality Abortion in the United States Mexico Mr. and Mrs. Turner Franz Boas Theodicy Generation X The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Time Out of Mind Infantilism Adoption Culture of Mexico EastEnders Recurring South Park characters Child custody Good Times Incest Western United States Music genre Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Married... with Children Cowboy Fathers' rights movement in the UK Mestizo Joke Mexican-American War Same-sex marriage Timmy Turner Kyle Broflovski Philosophy One Tree Hill (TV series) Transactional analysis Lauren Bacall W.I.T.C.H.
