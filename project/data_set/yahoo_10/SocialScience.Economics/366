rhenan capitalism and italy why has italy been the worst performing g country in recent years read this one year old report and think about what helps discipline and efficiency of non discriminating competitive markets for everything including labor but excluding few unavoidable social goods or corrupt fascists govts that distribute favours and capable of protecting the lazy and the incompetent in the name of protecting the weak and the poor march ''economic brief italy's weak economy'' by the organization for economic cooperation and development o e c d figures that were published on march in the annual organization's factbook confirm that italy's economy is in a crisis although the same sources say italian companies expect that the situation will improve five years down the road as pinr argued the present government has proved unable to perform significant reforms in its last year before the elections so that a continuation of the country's malaise and poor economic performance was inevitable such a framework is reflected by national and international statistics g d p figures for the last quarter of highlight the lack of growth coupled by a fall in consumer spending and investments moreover analysts have pointed out that high inventories may be bad for output prospects because businesses could end up drawing on stocks to meet demand at the expense of an output incr whose poor performance has reflected the sluggishness of its three core economies germany france and italy which account for of euro area gdp all three suffer from europe's familiar troubles of excessive labour and product market rigidities too high public spending and taxes and too much regulation yet last week's news that italy fell back into recession in the first quarter of while france and germany picked up suggests that italy has even graver problems than the bigger two those problems are spread wide across the economy business and politics as this week's oecd report on italy highlights again the country's slow economic growth mainly reflects its structural failings the miracle years of the s and s created an economy that depended heavily on small manufacturing firms many of them concentrated in the north and in such specialist areas as textiles furniture machine tools food processing and white goods such companies needed a low cost base to sustain competitiveness in times of inflation this was secured by devaluations of the lira that get out is no longer available now that italy is using the euro it also happens that these industries are the ones most vulnerable not just to competition from the rest of europe but increasingly from asia notably china it is no surprise that italy's textile firms are in the forefront of those demanding new protection from brussels against chinese exports makers of furniture and white goods are suffering similarly and italian companies are losing market share to chinese rivals not just in europe but in world markets too no wonder businessmen in italy are feeling ever more pessimistic even as they struggle to cope with a somnolent economy they can also point to a string of recent steps that have undermined their own confidence as well as that of foreign investors see article things began to go visibly wrong two years ago when trouble still unresolved erupted at fiat the country's flagship carmaker and when italy's retail banks arrogantly sold high risk bonds to their customers as if they were safe the bonds were issued by argentina and by two italian firms cirio and parmalat the country defaulted while the two food groups went bust the fraud that brought down parmalat showed that italy's system of corporate governance was rotten the regulatory response though quick at first became sluggish once politicians thought a crisis had been averted although parmalat has been rescued prosecution of those who nearly destroyed it has been less than zealous this reverses a slow trend for such companies to become independent of the political graft and favours that once made italy pay a big premium to borrow in international markets mr scaroni now has a chance to prove that he can resist political interference just as mr mincato did but eni's shareholders will be watching nervously to see how the company behaves under its new management similarly foreign investors are waiting to see whether the extraordinary saga of two attempted takeovers of italian banks by foreign ones ends happily ie the foreigners win or in farce at this point the outcome remains hazy but the bank of italy and consob italy's stockmarket regulator have so far displayed a disturbing mixture of protectionism and sloth italy's poor performance has not only damaged business it has also undermined living standards that is the main reason italians are turning away from the centre right coalition led by silvio berlusconi that has been in office since although mr berlusconi got better news from local elections in sicily this week see article other recent elections have confirmed that his government is now deeply unpopular distracted by legal matters dependent on his fractious coalition partners mr berlusconi has delivered too few reforms though his personal business interests have prospered his cure for italy's public finances has been mostly one off measures such as tax amnesties the budget deficit is now ballooning again he has managed to cut taxes a little but nothing like as much as he once promised he has made some changes to pensions and social security but in general his reform efforts have been too little too late ease what is even more worrisome for italy is that the country lacks good results in almost every key field to be competitive in the globalized economy whereas both western powers especially the u s the u k the scandinavian countries spain and in part also germany and asian rising stars such as china south korea and india are showing strength areas where italy is lacking include basic scientific research innovation in high tech and labor productivity also disappointing is the lack of strategy to reduce the country's alarming energy dependence during the election campaign marked by bitter competition between the ruling right of center majority and its left of center challengers political leaders have once again evoked foreign countries' policies to reverse the negative trends since a social crisis may erupt when liberal oriented labor rules are actually implemented the next government will need to work hard to avoid being destabilized by predictable harsh criticisms should substantial reforms be rapidly introduced and a new optimism surface expect foreign investors to compete for taking the best advantage out of it read also the review in the economist as follows for a while the country's ills have seemed merely part of those of the wider euro zone
