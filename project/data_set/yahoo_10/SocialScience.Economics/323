how is free market capitalism diffrent from facism or social democracy in what ways do they differ in each others respects from conventional capitalism after all capitalist institutions like stock markets private companies ect can exist comfortablely as far to the right as fascism or as far to the left as social democracy these are all generalizations but hopefully point out some differences free market capitalism relies on the self interests of the purchaser of goods and services to select those goods and services that are of good quality and affordable in this way all vendors of the goods or services have an economic incentive to improve quality and reduce prices socialism says that for many goods and services capitalism is not the best model social programs hence the name socialism requires a pooling of resources and a requirement to relegate profits to a secondary position universal health care is an example and while not perfect arguably it produces a healthier population overall than the capitalist model democratic socialism is socialism in which the people rather than a central government decide which programs and to what extent those social programs will be exempt from the need to be self sustaining through profits i e the capitalist model fascism is the theory that a single controlling authority that has knowledge of all the facts should dictate social policy under fascism the western model of capitalism doesn't work interestingly the application of fascism is closer to the theory of communism than it is to socialism Capitalism Socialism Privatization Free trade Intellectual property Microeconomics Inflation Keynesian economics Fascism Social democracy Public policy Publicly funded medicine Anarchism and capitalism Free market Unemployment Natural monopoly Labor theory of value Political economy Criticisms of socialism Monopoly Liberalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Supply-side economics Ownership Anti-communism Left-wing politics Health insurance Gross domestic product Anarchism and society American individualist anarchism Democracy Planned economy Law of value Economic inequality Supply and demand Corporate governance Karl Marx Economy of Norway Conservatism Economic calculation problem Sociocultural evolution National Health Service Economy of Russia Corporation Economy of India Network effect Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Organic farming Insurance American Conservatism Corporate finance Socialist economics Political spectrum Social justice Right-wing politics Wal-Mart Globalization Strategic management Annuity Organic food History of the United States (1918-1945) State Nazism Commodity Communitarianism Anarchist economics Capital accumulation Libertarianism Market failure FairTax Price discrimination Left-Right politics Libertarian socialism Software engineering Productive and unproductive labour Socialism with Chinese characteristics Economy of the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Market economy Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Economy of Pakistan Graduate school Economy of South Africa Individualist anarchism Hyperinflation Psychology Model (economics) Worldwide green parties History of the People's Republic of China (2/4) Monetary policy Trademark History of economic thought Management
