question about econmics comparable worth is the name of a movement that began in the s to determine the worth of different jobs and then to adjust relative wage rates to the relative worth of those jobs the movement gains most of its support from the belief that women are unfairly discriminated against in the labor market the jobs at which most of them work e g secretaries and nurse are widely and unfairly regarded as women s jobs and so are allegedly paid less than their comparable worth the comparison is with jobs traditionally held by men a can a job have an inherent worth can you think of any question where the worth of a job is not its value to some particular party in a specific situation b imagine a medical clinic with medical doctors one nurse and one laboratory technician is it plausible to suppose that an additional nurse or lab technician could have more worth to the clinic in such a situation than an additional doctor c the worth or value that influences decisions is always marginal worth or value why is a secretary worth more to the economics department if it employs only one than if it employs eight describe a situation in which the worth of a secretary to the economics department would likely be greater than the worth of an economist fully armed with a ph d d why will an employer who follows the maximizing rule of chapter do more if marginal revenue want to pay each employee a wage equal to his or her marginal worth what would be implied by the assertion that an employer was paying employees less than their marginal worth a anytime jobs are limited by outside intervention the job will not be paid an efficient wage b sure it is probably likely given your desciption that the marginal value product of a dr is lower then the nurse however it must be viewed from a stand point that a doctor can do everything a nurse can do but a nurse can not do everything a doctor can do that is from a legal standpoint c again their is diminishing value to work done by a secretary hiring gains a large benefit the th will not it is very difficult to compare the marginal value of a professor vs a secretary a phd can teach do research bring in grants a secretary can not d the problem is informational if the employer is paying a wage less then the marginal product value then the employee is in error why is the employee taking the wage if the employee has no other option for work then they are being paid their marginal value as determined by the market otherwise some other firm would hire them away for a wage just above what they are receiving now Microeconomics Unemployment Labour economics Economic inequality Monopsony Economics Inflation Supply and demand Efficiency wages Trade union Principal-agent problem Affirmative action Tax Minimum wage Capitalism Division of labour Paralegal Exploitation Progressive tax Wal-Mart Labor theory of value Labor-power Free trade Theory of the firm Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Price discrimination Keynesian economics Publicly funded medicine Unemployment types Conscription New Deal Welfare economics Insurance Medicine Anarchism and capitalism Monopoly FairTax Abortion debate Law of value Nurse American individualist anarchism Monetary policy Prostate cancer Outsourcing Tariff Supply-side economics Externality Say's law Mediation Immigration to the United States Economy of the United States Surplus labour Pharmaceutical company Education in Portugal Production theory basics Economic rent Neoclassical economics Civil rights Capital accumulation Employment Criticism of libertarianism Offshoring Public good Single Transferable Vote Surplus value Production function Education in the People's Republic of China Privatization Software engineering Strategic management Taxation in the United States Free market Capital controversy Graduate school Psychology Intelligent design Expert system Gross domestic product Anarcho-capitalism Roe v.
