which states in the usa allow metric only labeling the first yard when the roman empire passed into history about six hundred years after the time of christ europe drifted into the dark ages for six or seven hundred years mankind generally made little progress with regard to standardizing measurement sometime after the magna carta was signed in the thirteenth century king edward i of england took a step forward he ordered a permanent measuring stick made of iron to serve as a master standard yardstick for the entire kingdom this master yardstick was called the iron ulna after the bone of the forearm and it was standardized as the length of a yard very close to the length of our present day yard king edward realized that constancy and permanence were the key to any standard he also decreed that the foot measure should be one third the length of the yard and the inch one thirty sixth king edward ii in reverted back to the seed concept of the ancients and passed a statute that three barleycorns round and dry make an inch however seeds as well as fingers and feet were no match for a world that soon was to emerge from the ignorance and unrefined practices of the dark ages the first meter as the scientists were experimenting in their laboratories practical tradesmen were making themselves permanent standards in during napoleon's time the french government adopted a new system of standards called the metric system based on what they called the meter the meter was supposed to be one tenth millionth the length of the distance from the north pole to the equator when measured on a straight line running along the surface of the earth through paris with the meter now determined as the basis of the metric system other linear units of the system were set up in decimal ratios with the meter with this system all units are in multiples of ten ten decimeters in a meter a hundred centimeters in a meter and a thousand millimeters in a meter in the other direction there are ten meters in a dekameter a hundred meters in a hectometer and a thousand meters in a kilometer compared to the yardstick the meter is just a little longer inches long the french government thought it had an infallible system of weights and measures that would be easy to use and would be embraced by everyone but people were accustomed to thinking in terms of yards inches pounds and quarts at first the new meter as a measure of length proved confusing most frenchmen thought in the old familiar terms doing some mental arithmetic to convert one quantity into another and after nineteen years napoleon finally was forced to renounce the metric system however in france again went back to the meter this time for good hoping to make it universal throughout the world while france was evolving the metric system england also was setting up a more scientifically accurate determination of the yard where the french relied on the assumed constancy of the earth's size as a basis for the permanency of their standards the british turned to the measured beat of the pendulum galileo already had learned the secrets of a pendulum he found that the length of time it took for a pendulum to complete a swing depended upon the length of the pendulum itself the longer the pendulum the slower it swung he also found that a pendulum a little over inches long would swing through its arc in exactly one second since a pendulum always behaves exactly the same way under the same conditions here was another unchanging distance upon which to base a standard measurement in the english parliament legalized a new standard yard which had been made in it was a brass bar containing a gold button near each end a dot was engraved in each of these two buttons these two dots were spaced exactly yard apart the same act that legalized this bar as the standard for england also made the provision that in the event it was lost or destroyed it should be replaced using the pendulum method to determine its length a few years later copies of both the english yard and the french meter standards were brought to the united states the english system of measuring was almost universally adopted in the united states in spite of repeated requests in congress there was no legal length standard in the u s until more or less authentic copies of the british copies of the yard were used as length prototypes in the treasury department decided to admit as a legal yard the distance between the lines and of a certain bronze bar inches in length bought in in england for the federal survey department when the british yard bar which was destroyed in was replaced in a new bronze copy no was sent to the united states which became the legal american yard standard converting the united states since the mid nineteenth century the united states has made several attempts at converting over to the world standard on may the united states became a charter member of the metric club having signed the original document the treaty of the meter in paris they were the only english speaking nation to do so since then nations have signed this treaty including all the major industrialized countries in the us congress passed the metric conversion act and although made with good intentions the treaties acts established institutes and passed legislation have yet to push through the change the us remains the last holdout while the rest of the world is pretty much standardized on the metric system of measurements when it comes to mandatory use the united states has company in its foot dragging great britain liberia and burma are right there along with the united states some international organizations have threatened to restrict u s imports that do not conform to metric standards and rather than trying to maintain dual inventories for domestic and foreign markets a number of u s corporations have chosen to go metric some motor vehicles farm machinery and computer equipment are now manufactured to metric specifications you will be seeing more and more of your customers in the us using the metric system in their purchases with you as their customers make more and more original specifications in metric
