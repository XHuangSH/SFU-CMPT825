what do you think about the future of u s economy i don't know that much about economics but i keep hearing that the dollar keeps decreasing in value and about outsourcing of jobs other people have also brought up issues about gas prices and environmental effects the future of social security and medicare are other issues it seems to me like not too many people are optimistic about our economy what do you think the people who are not optimistic about the economy do not understand what made the us the economy in the first place innovation the world has undergone greater technological change in the past few hundred years since the usa was founded than in all the years of human history prior to that point as long as the us maintains the role of world leader in innovation barring some major catastrophe the us economy will keep on surging i am very optimistic about the us economy with one caveat all these issues will get taken care of assuming that the government does something to reign in corporate executives gone wild the escalating corporate executive salary is the most crippling influence by far on the economy almost all of our current major woes are trickle down effects of the government's failure to put a cap on ceo salaries gas prices are kept high so that execs can make million year instead of etc as it stands now ceos and other execs set up kickback deals with the board of directors so that the board approves outrageous pay packages and gets greased down the road nardelli for example i'm sure is a master at setting up offshore accounts for these purposes that's why the chrysler board members jumped at the chance to get this loser they want to get a bigger piece of the pie before the ship sinks millions upon millions are lost this way public corporations are government subsidized entities and the executives should be limited as such otherwise shareholders employees and the american public get hurt Microeconomics Enron Corporation Economy of the United States Inflation Tax Trade union Wal-Mart Capitalism Microsoft Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security (United States) Monetary policy National Kidney Foundation Singapore Free trade Publicly funded medicine Kyoto Protocol Supply and demand Capital accumulation Economy of Russia Economy of India Outsourcing New Deal Management Health insurance History of the United States (1918-1945) Corporation Future energy development Gross domestic product Mergers and acquisitions Economic inequality Welfare economics Bretton Woods system Canadian and American health care systems compared Great Depression Asian financial crisis Petroleum Executive compensation United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Strategic management Stock Temasek Holdings Keynesian economics Economic history of Japan Chrysler Corporation United States Economy of Norway Offshoring Externality Warren Buffett Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Mutual fund Steve Jobs Economy of Uzbekistan Nuclear power Anarchism and capitalism Economy of the Republic of Ireland Model (economics) Health care in the United States Independence Party (Iceland) Social Security debate (United States) Royal Dutch Shell FairTax Tariff Economy of the People's Republic of China Coalition Provisional Authority Monopoly Commodity markets Immigration to the United States Economics Pharmaceutical company MMORPG Reaganomics Economy of Nigeria Globalization Unemployment Technology ExxonMobil Salary cap Economy of Pakistan Software engineering Technocratic movement Coal History of post-Soviet Russia Economic growth Local government in the United Kingdom Incentive Xerox Political economy Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 U.S. public debt
