wat are the characteristics of business cycles the business cycle or economic cycle refers to the fluctuations of economic activity about its long term growth trend the cycle involves shifts over time between periods of relatively rapid growth of output recovery and prosperity and periods of relative stagnation or decline contraction or recession these fluctuations are often measured using the real gross domestic product despite being named cycles these fluctuations in economic growth and decline do not follow a purely mechanical or predictable periodic pattern the main types of business cycles enumerated by joseph schumpeter and others in this field have been named after their discoverers or proposers the kitchin inventory cycle years after joseph kitchin the juglar fixed investment cycle years after clement juglar the kuznets infrastructural investment cycle years after simon kuznets nobel laureate the kondratieff wave or cycle years after nikolai kondratieff even longer cycles are occasionally proposed often as multiples of the kondratiev cycle edit juglar cycle in the juglar cycle which is sometimes called the business cycle recovery and prosperity are associated with increases in productivity consumer confidence aggregate demand and prices in the cycles before world war ii or that of the late s in the united states the growth periods usually ended with the failure of speculative investments built on a bubble of confidence that bursts or deflates in these cycles the periods of contraction and stagnation reflect a purging of unsuccessful enterprises as resources are transferred by market forces from less productive uses to more productive uses cycles between and the s in the united states were generally more restrained and followed political factors such as fiscal policy and monetary policy automatic stabilisation due to the government's budget helped defeat the cycle even without conscious action done by policy makers edit politically based business cycle models another set of models tries to derive the business cycle from political decisions the partisan business cycle suggests that cycles result from the successive elections of administrations with different policy regimes regime a adopts expansionary policies resulting in growth and inflation but is voted out of office when inflation becomes unacceptably high the replacement regime b adopts contractionary policies reducing inflation and growth and the downwards swing of the cycle it is voted out of office when unemployment is too high being replaced by party a the political business cycle is an alternative theory stating that when an administration of any hue is elected it initially adopts a contractionary policy to reduce inflation and gain a reputation for economic competence it then adopts an expansionary policy in the lead up to the next election hoping to achieve simultaneously low inflation and unemployment on polling day the business cycle is the rises and falls of the economy this maintains neutrality between supply and demand business cycles as we know them today were first identified and analyzed by arthur burns and wesley mitchell in their book measuring business cycles one of their key insights was that many economic indicators move together during a boom or expansion not only does output rise but also employment rises and unemployment falls new construction and prices typically rise during a boom as well conversely during a downturn or depression not only does the output of goods and services decline but employment falls and unemployment rises as well new construction also declines in the era before world war ii prices also typically fell during a recession since the fifties prices have risen during downturns though usually more slowly than during booms in many ways the term business cycle is misleading cycle seems to imply that there is some regularity in the timing and duration of upswings and downswings in economic activity most economists however believe otherwise booms and recessions occur at irregular intervals and last for varying lengths of time for example economic activity hit low points in and the trough was then followed by eight years of uninterrupted expansion for describing the swings in economic activity therefore most modern economists prefer the term economic fluctuations just as there is no regularity in the timing of business cycles there is no reason why cycles have to occur at all the prevailing view among economists is that there is a level of economic activity often referred to as full employment at which the economy theoretically could stay forever full employment refers to a level of production at which all the inputs to the production process are being used but not so intensively that they wear out break down or insist on higher wages and more vacations if nothing disturbs the economy the full employment level of output which naturally tends to grow as the population increases and new technologies are discovered can be maintained forever there is no reason why a time of full employment has to give way to either a full fledged boom or a recession business cycles do occur however because there are disturbances to the economy of one sort or another booms can be generated by surges in private or public spending for example if the government spends a lot of money to fight a war but does not raise taxes the increased demand will cause not only an increase in the output of war materiel but also an increase in the take home pay of government plant workers the output of all the goods and services that these workers want to buy with their wages will also increase similarly a wave of optimism that causes consumers to spend more than usual and firms to build new factories will cause the economy to expand recessions or depressions can be caused by these same forces working in reverse a substantial cut in government spending or a wave of pessimism among consumers and firms may cause the output of all types of goods to fall
