why countries currency value changes what are all the factors that determine the currencies value the short answer is gross domestic product and levels of imports and exports a healthy economy that brings income both to the people and to the government tends to have a higher currency valuation it's also relative to the countries with which trade occurs for instance the british pound right now is valued at about pound to every us dollars the dollar is so low because our imports have been steadily increasing while our exports have been decreasing there's also the question of foreign investment in american stocks bonds property etc the more foreign companies own of america the lower the value of american assets back when clinton was president things happened to be a lot better and the dollar was even valued higher than the pound the economy was in a much better state and the citizens were also spending a lot more of their earnings which then fed the economy to keep it healthy a couple of other things that affect the value of a currency is the actual amount of physical currency that exists and the gold stored in fort knox in the us and the current value of gold in the world market the us treasury burns in old bills per day while they print generally the same amount in new bills the balancing of these helps keep things stabilized we can choose to put more physical money into circulation but this can affect inflation and lower the value of the dollar the whole thing with gold is that it's a valued resource that always has some value and one that tends to increase or remain stable rather than decrease in value of course the more demand there is for a currency the higher the value of the currency relative to that of other nations Monetary policy Gross domestic product Bretton Woods system Gold standard Pound sterling Asian financial crisis Economy of Russia Hyperinflation United States dollar Economy of India Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Microeconomics Debt Bond U.S. public debt Euro Money supply Gold as an investment Argentine Currency Board Economy of the United States Government debt Money Capitalism Supply-side economics Economy of Pakistan Supply and demand Arbitrage Economic inequality Economy of Chile Law of value Currency PE ratio Legal tender Economy of Colombia Economy of Brazil Arthur Laffer FairTax Renminbi Economic history of Spain Economy of Romania Economy of Africa Economy of Cuba Federal Reserve Economy of Argentina Economy of Papua New Guinea Economics Exchange rate Monetarism Economy of Guyana Yield curve Economy of Ghana Economic relations of Japan Free trade Tax Tariff Reaganomics Progressive tax United States Fiat money Economy of Hungary International Monetary Fund History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of the Philippines Surplus value Balance of trade Economy of Fiji Marshall Plan Economic history of Britain Trade Economy of Kuwait MMORPG Kazakhstan Economy of Singapore Economy of Belgium Gold Labour economics Neoliberalism RuneScape economy Security (finance) Property tax Economy of Peru Wealth Central bank Economy of Israel El Salvador Commodity markets Economy of the Czech Republic Romania Political economy Minimum wage
