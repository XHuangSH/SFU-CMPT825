why doesn't the u s start making more products here in the states it seems we are dependent on imports from other countries namely china to the point where as many have said it would literally cause our country to collapse economically if we halted imports from china alone why do we depend so much on other countries why don't we start making products here wouldn't it be better in the longrun even if it may not be as cheap i'm no economist but it just seems like the best way plus we'd create a whole lot of jobs we couldn't afford the products if they were made in the usa because its unlawful to pay anyone under an hour in the usa which in alot of other countries is not the case for example as of a year ago i'm not sure if they joined fair trade yet or not starbucks bought its coffee for a pound from ethiopia then turned around and sold it in the states for a pound the other thing that people commonly fail to mention is that at the moment china is deflating its exchange rate meaning the yuan when exchanged for us dollars buys less here then it does in china they do this because other wise i would be cheaper to produce in other parts of the world the only thing that china could do to collapse our economy is to nationalize all the factories which some communist countries have been known to do before this is scary because international corperations seam to think that the factories they own in china work the same way it would in the west they have complete control over them when in fact they don't Gross domestic product Deflation (economics) Bretton Woods system Asian financial crisis Renminbi Capitalism Monetary policy Productive and unproductive labour Trade Free trade Gold standard Hyperinflation Economy of Cuba Pound sterling Great Depression Economy of Europe Sweatshop People's Republic of China Capital accumulation United States dollar Inflation Law of value Economy of Africa Currency Microeconomics Euro Surplus value Tariff Yugo Debt Economics Wal-Mart Exchange rate Starbucks Fiat money Arthur Laffer Political economy Offshoring International Monetary Fund Arbitrage Economy of Taiwan Economy of Chile Economy of the United States Economic history of Britain Economy of Russia Canadian and American economies compared Economy of the European Union Economy of Papua New Guinea Economy of Venezuela Agricultural policy Economy of Hong Kong Hard currency Marshall Plan Anarchism and capitalism Derivative (finance) Say's law Surplus labour Petroleum Labour economics Flat tax Economy of Mexico Dairy Great Depression in the United Kingdom Dot-com Cotton 1973 oil crisis Purchasing power parity Economy of India Anarchism and society World economy Economy of Pakistan U.S. public debt Charles Ponzi Economy of Haiti League of Nations Economy of Rwanda Money Kyoto Protocol Surplus product Asia Ford Motor Company Theory of conduct Economy of Macau Anarchist economics Friends Commodity Make money fast Hong Kong dollar Economy of Albania Pakistan Economy of Sierra Leone Economy of Nigeria Keynesian economics Supply-side economics Intellectual property Agriculture
