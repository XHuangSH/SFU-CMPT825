will western countries ever break their dependency on oil will it even reduce the answer is not yet the infrastructure in the west is too reliant on oil for the west to break their reliance in the short run our production and capital relies on the supply of global oil to work effectively and efficiently while it is the most environmentally friendly thing and will have the most social benefits in the future if we do use more renewable and eco friendly fuels then it will take a very long time to implement firstly there is not likely to be any regulation very soon by the governments or corporations to say that they must cut down on the use of oil in production many are concerned more with their own self interest by way of profits or economic growth rather than the sustainable use of scarce factor resources available secondly the western corporations and governments are somewhat disinterested in investing in such areas as research and development r d and innovation and invention especially in an 'anti oil' campaign although a lot of headway could be made in the unexplored venture for alternative resources to use this is due to the smear campaign that would follow that their aims would not strengthen but weaken the west this however is due to the narrowmindedness of humanity which cannot see beyond the reaches of their own reinforced bubble which shields them from any guilt they might feel as their descendants are forced to search for alternative fuels in future years because we were too ignorant to do it in this day and age thirdly it would take time for the conversion to be implemented from oil to such alternatives as biofuels which are so much harder to produce as they use up crops such as maize which are necessary in the west therefore the state should take the opportunity cost into lesser account than the future social costaccount the opportunity cost of the decision is that it might degrade our productive ability for a matter of years however the social cost would be for an improved economical infrastructure for future generations which will ensure that they are able to take advantage of renewable resources before we are forced to once all non renewable resources are used up i feel i must maintain that as long as western powers stay in iraq it is clear that oil is part of the agenda if not all of it this evidently displays the greedy behaviour of governments to obtain such resources for personal gain by abusing others unjustly i fear that the only way that we will become independent from the addiction our industrialised states have developed is to go cold turkey unfortunately the only way i can see any of the g forgoing oil is if it all runs out by which point the world economy will slump dramatically it is better to plan for the future than to improvise when we get there in the long run so long as the correct institutional and infrastructural amendments are made independency or at least a reduced dependency which will prolong the supply of oil for more important purposes than making plastic commodities which will later be landfilled is attainable Microeconomics Capitalism Free trade Privatization Energy development Nuclear power Economy of Africa Alternative fuel Renewable energy Capital accumulation Alcohol fuel Inflation Biofuel Oil depletion Corporate governance Hubbert peak theory Commodity markets Deflation (economics) Economy of the People's Republic of China Organic farming Implications of peak oil Political economy Law of value Petroleum Economics 1973 oil crisis Economy of Colombia Hydrogen economy Economy of the United States Anarchism and capitalism Nuclear energy policy Economy of South Africa Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Nuclear power phase-out Economy of Norway Sustainability Strategic management Economy of Russia Surplus value Globalization Unemployment Economic history of Japan Economy of Pakistan Intellectual property Economic growth Energy crisis Economy of Ghana Microcredit Overpopulation Technology Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Corporate social responsibility Gross domestic product Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Sewage treatment Opportunity cost Gold standard World government Green Revolution Tax Economy of Belgium Economy of Brazil Economic inequality Agriculture in Australia Wealth Industrial Revolution Agriculture Keynesian economics Waste management Monetary policy Biodiversity Economy of Venezuela Economy of Papua New Guinea Economy of the Republic of Ireland United Nations Solar power Economy of the Philippines Monopoly Rise of Nations Corporation Trade and development Wind power Worldwide green parties Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration Commonwealth of Nations World Bank Group Economic history of Spain Economy of Singapore Supply and demand Primitive accumulation of capital Public policy Economic relations of Japan
