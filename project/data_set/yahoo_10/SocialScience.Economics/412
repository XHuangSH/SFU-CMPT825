why is joint profit mzximization not a nash equilibrium explanation for the difference between the nash equilibrium prices and those that maximize joint profit why is joint profit mzximization not a nash equilibrium let me illustrate the answer with a simple example suppose that you and i are the only producers of a valuable commodity we can earn higher profits if we agree on a price rather than compete with each other but once we agree on a price we each have incentives to secretly cheat for example if i secretly offer buyers the opportunity to buy the product at just cent below the agreed price the one you are offering to the market i can capture all the market buyers rather than just half of them you have the same incentives so the agreed price the one that maximizes joint profits is not a stable equilibrium Microeconomics Supply and demand Capitalism Economics Labor theory of value Tax Monopoly Ford Motor Company Commodity Price discrimination Surplus value Free market Privatization Incentive Capital controversy Ultimatum game Anarchism and capitalism Arbitrage Monopsony Efficiency wages Game theory Inflation General equilibrium Law of value Keynesian economics Free trade Prisoner's dilemma Technical analysis Neoclassical economics Economic equilibrium Transformation problem Investment bank PE ratio Cournot competition Eugene Fama Bertrand competition FairTax Stackelberg competition Prices of production Evolutionarily stable strategy Bretton Woods system Enron Corporation Rational expectations Market economy Profit Progressive tax Islamic banking Mutual fund Natural monopoly Model (economics) Stock market Call option Put option Commodity markets Futures contract Economic rent Criticisms of socialism Rational pricing MMORPG Tariff Welfare economics Topps Day trading Stock Pricing Mergers and acquisitions Deflation (economics) American individualist anarchism The Market for Lemons Karl Marx Economic calculation problem Internet fraud Capital accumulation Strategic management Phillips curve Predatory lending Gold standard Socially necessary labour time Monetary policy Wal-Mart Minimum wage ITunes Music Store Profit maximization Marginal cost American Motors History of post-Soviet Russia Perfect competition Externality The Wealth of Nations Illegal drug trade Principal-agent problem Model (abstract) Productive and unproductive labour Economic inequality Google
