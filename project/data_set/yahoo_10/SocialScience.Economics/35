what does vietnam spend its budget on does anyone know or have a link to somewhere that shows the categorical expenditures of vietnam's budget i researched this information a couple years ago but i lost the resources that i found so i will have to give you what i know off the top of my head vietnam's communist government is not a trusted source for actual revenue and expenditures because the previous administration was renowned for pocketing government funds for their own self interests furthermore there are numerous state run businesses that are quite profitable and add to the government's overall profit and loss another answer you received is obviously incorrect concerning vietnam's military spending vietnam military expenditure is relatively low compared to other countries i believe military expense was about or less than half of a b bomber the largest government expenditure is energy vietnam doesn't produce enough electricity to sustain itself and imports most of it from china lots of money has been spent and will be spent on improving domestic energy production in trying to keep up with their rapidly increasing economy transportation is supposed to be a large expenditure in vietnam as roads and and mass transportation is highly inadequate however the former transportation minister had siphoned much of his expenditures and payoffs for his personal use lots of money is spent on influencing foreign business and money to operate and invest in vietnam foreign companies are the preferred employers because they pay better and provide more opportunity for advancement i know the information i've provided is a bit vague and general but i hope this will help you find more specific information that you're looking for Economy of India Economy of Pakistan Economy of Nigeria Microeconomics Economy of Russia Inflation Economy of Venezuela Tax Economy of Norway Economy of Ghana United Kingdom corporation tax Nuclear power Social Security (United States) Economy of Papua New Guinea Economy of South Africa Bretton Woods system People's Republic of China Privatization Economy of Singapore Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Free trade Coalition Provisional Authority Great Depression Insurance Energy development Economy of Belgium Measures of national income and output Deficit spending FairTax Economy of the Czech Republic History of the United States (1980-1988) Vietnam Capitalism Economy of Chile History of the United States (1918-1945) Finance Economy of Sierra Leone Indian Railways Future energy development Economy of Greece Life insurance Hyperinflation Government debt Economy of the United States Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Economy of Colombia Manitoba Hydro Publicly funded medicine Economy of Belize Economic history of Japan Marshall Plan Economy of Trinidad and Tobago Economy of Mexico Oil boom Economy of Peru History of North Korea Celtic Tiger Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Economy of Iceland Economy of Egypt Niger Income trust Economy of Romania Economy of the Central African Republic Economy of Rwanda Surplus value Margaret Thatcher Economy of Fiji Toronto-Dominion Bank Microcredit Economy of Nepal Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economy of Cuba Amtrak Economy of Bahrain Capital accumulation VIA Rail Corporate finance PE ratio Canadian and American economies compared Economy of Taiwan Reaganomics Economy of Sri Lanka Economy of the People's Republic of China Alcohol fuel Supply-side economics Poker jargon Economy of Lithuania
