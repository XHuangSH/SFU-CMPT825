can't answer algerbra puzzle need more help often death is thought to be the end of life while this may be true for individuals it is not true for life in general the processes of decomposition and decay are essential for the sleath is necessary for this cache generation of new life and in recognition of earth day this cache was placed in an area where there is much death but also much life decay is also associated with non living things such as radioisotopes solving this puzzle will provide some exposure to this depending upon your expertise in algebra you may consider the cache s rating as either too high or too low the actual coordinates for the cache are n xx xxx w yy yyy the north coordinate is associated with the radioactive element known as geocacharium like geocachers it is an extremely stable substance in fact if you start with pounds of geocacharium at time zero after years pounds of it still remain starting with pounds xx xxx represents the amount of geocacharium left after years the west coordinate is associated with a much less stable radioactive element known as politicianarium reflecting this instability its rate constant is only starting with pounds of politicianarium and allowing it to decay yy yyy is the amount of politicianarium left after two half lifes days ago answer report abuse add save save to my web add to del icio us add to my yahoo rss show who starred r tmember since may total points level points earned this week best answer r t best answer chosen by you use the decay formula a a exp kt a amount remaining a inital amount k rate constant t time in case of geocacharium exp k gives rate constant as approx so xx xxx exp e negligibly small with yy yyy after half lives the amount would have reduced to th yy yyyy substitue and find ur coordinates out your rating i guess i don't get it the digits don't add up xx xxx doesn't and what is the e in that answer for xx xxx i do get the yy yyy xx xxx is such a small number that it is in essence zero e is the exponential function so xx xxx equals times e to the power you would need an exponential table to find the value of the part of the equation involving e Explosive material Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Exponential function CPU cache Radioactive decay Exponential growth Discrete Fourier transform Exponentiation Quicksort Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Technetium Radiometric dating Uranium Normal distribution Nuclear fallout Orthogonal matrix Dynamical system Complex number Polynomial Action potential Nuclear fission Formal power series Radioactive waste Hydrogen Exponential distribution Trigonometric function Crossword Derivation of the partition function Determinant Expert system CPU design Continuous Fourier transform Plutonium Lorentz group Helium Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Numerical analysis Poisson distribution Nuclear reactor Transformation problem Force Large numbers Heat equation Inflation Age of the Earth Combinatorics RISC Complexity classes P and NP Statistical mechanics Wheel of Fortune Gravity Planetary orbit Modular form Interest Two-body problem Exponential decay Ionizing radiation Telephone numbering plan Theory of conduct British Locomotive and Multiple Unit Numbering and Classification Radioactive contamination Probability Iron Nuclear fuel cycle Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Fibonacci number Lie group Manganese IP (complexity) Collision detection Vector (spatial) North American Numbering Plan Mathematics of general relativity Hydrogeology Exponentiation by squaring Electrophysiology Special relativity Photosynthesis Integral Web crawler Derivative Analog-to-digital converter Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Password P-adic number Nuclear fusion Quantum tunneling Black body Law of value Matrix exponential
