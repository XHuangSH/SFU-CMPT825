what are the practical importance of price elasticity of demand for the government please explain in economics terms although there are five elasticities of demand perfectly elastic perfectly inelastic inelastic elastic and unit elastic the first two elasticities of demand hardly existed anyway i think the importance of price elasticity is for the government to intervene the price by imposing price ceiling or price floor depending on the situation if the price elasticity of demand for a particular item is inelastic it is most likely to be a necessity thus when the price of the good is set too high due to some factors the government is able to intervene by imposing a price ceiling to protect the consumers when the price elasticity of demand for a particular item is elastic it is most likely to be a luxury sometimes when the price is set too high the demand for that good will drop which in turn will affect the suppliers at that time the government can impose a price floor to protect the suppliers thus by knowing the price elasticities of demand the government is able to understand the impact of the price on the demand of the consumers and therefore enable it to intervene Supply and demand Microeconomics Elasticity (economics) Inflation Monopoly Labour economics Keynesian economics Tax Real estate economics Tariff Pricing Capitalism Economy of the United States Natural monopoly Publicly funded medicine Great Depression Monopsony Giffen good Protectionism Progressive tax Economics Perfect competition Luxury good Price discrimination Health insurance Free trade FairTax Free market Economic relations of Japan Value added tax Excise Economy of India Economic shortage Unemployment Law of value Subsidy Equine conformation Price skimming Economic calculation problem Minimum wage Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Neoclassical economics Monetary policy Asian financial crisis Collision Yield curve Economic rent Labor theory of value Daewoo Capital accumulation Sticky (economics) Externality Black market Taxation in the United States Electronic commerce Information Services Procurement Library Gross domestic product Balassa-Samuelson effect 1973 oil crisis Shrimp farm Auction Organic food Economy of Sri Lanka General equilibrium Deflation (economics) Economy of Russia Advertising Implications of peak oil California electricity crisis Contract Viscosity Common Agricultural Policy Commodity Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Model (economics) Welding Momentum Ceteris paribus Management information system Economic history of Canada Mercantilism Oligopoly Gold standard Prices of production East Germany Gold as an investment Coercive monopoly Price gouging Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Use value Industrial Revolution Food and Drug Administration Quality of service Liberalism RuneScape economy Privatization Wal-Mart Outsourcing Political economy
