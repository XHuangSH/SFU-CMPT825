why the credibility problems that arise in th enon subgame perfect equilibria thx for those people who ans this question if you meant non subgame perfect equilibria i think i can help i think your e and n ran together non subgame perfect equilibria suffer from a number of potential problems first they may be unreachable it is possible to have nash equilibria which cannot be reached by the players it would be an optimum to play but no one can play it secondly there may be too many nash equilibriums for the potential solution set to be useful subgame perfect solutions are a subset of the nash solutions and so are easier in most cases to manage Subgame perfect equilibrium Bayesian game Extensive form game Solution concept Game theory Stackelberg competition Ultimatum game Surreal number Cournot competition General equilibrium Best response Backward induction Membrane potential Dynamical system Game of chicken Keynesian economics Microeconomics Slot machine Prisoner's dilemma Supply and demand Signaling games Labour economics Quantum harmonic oscillator Naive set theory Complexity classes P and NP Monopoly Combinatorics Phonon Glossary of game theory Genetic algorithm Action potential Public good Chemical equilibrium Law of value NP-complete John Forbes Nash Bertrand competition Paradox N-body problem Subset sum problem Fitness landscape Evolutionarily stable strategy Hash table Potts model Reinhard Selten Exact solutions in general relativity Magnetohydrodynamics Labor theory of value Economics Glossary of graph theory Incentive Tron (arcade game) Real number Newcomb's paradox Thermodynamics Halting problem Meaning Fusion power Hex (board game) Capitalism SubSpace (computer game) Mathematical model Free market Theory of conduct Mechanical equilibrium Poker Model (abstract) Garbage collection (computer science) $ale of the Century Infantilism Austrian School Institution Reduction (complexity) Route assignment Welfare economics Neoclassical economics Theodicy Entropy Simplex algorithm Chess problem Principal-agent problem Simulated annealing Heat equation Transformation problem CPU cache Anorexia nervosa Computational complexity theory Model (economics) Nuclear fusion Joseph Louis Lagrange Rational expectations Infinity Torque Dance Dance Revolution Temperature Partial pressure Stag hunt Oblate Monty Hall problem
