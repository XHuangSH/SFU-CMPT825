how much money is in the world an estimate just curious i saw something the other night on vh about guys who work for wallstreet and take home billions and billions a year for their salary i understand that new money is made every day but not a lot or that would cause inflation making the prices go up etc i know that we have different currencies so that's why i asked for an estimate in us dollars if you can otherwise i'll find a converter or something i think it'd be in the area of trillions of dollars but i really have no idea the answer to this depends upon exactly what your question is if your question is something like what is the total amount of money earned by all the people in the world in a year then the answer is very roughly trillion dollars the sum of the gnps gross national product for all the countries of the world note to the picky i realize that the gnp and gdp differ and that neither of those is the sum of earnings but i'm assuming that we're talking to a non economist here if your question is about the total price of all the things in the world rather than annual income spending then the amount is much higher but i don't know what it is probably around ten times as much trillion a third possible interpretation of your question is how many dollars are there if i counted up the physical dollars i don't know how much that adds up to but keep in mind that there are nowhere as many physical dollars in circulation as there are dollars being spent your boss pays you and you take those dollars to the grocery store and spend them and then the grocery store employees take those to the clothing store and so on if you get paid per year that doesn't mean that there are little green pieces of paper in fact the federal reserve board in the u s uses at least different measures of money the least important of which is the number of little pieces of paper and coins another includes money in checking accounts even though those dollars are electronic not paper metal the problem gets even more complex because using money to measure everything can be misleading someone once calculated the value of ecosystem services fresh water clean air etc as approximately trillion per year which was about the same as the world gdp per year trillion at the time but that's misleading the ecosystem services have an effectively infinite value because without them we are all dead another problem is that gnp gdp doesn't count volunteer work and doesn't count work by homemakers stay at home wives or husbands and farmers who grow just about as much as they eat buying or selling very little are calculated as adding almost nothing to the world gdp that's why you see numbers such as the average per person income in chad is per year obviously these people would all be dead if they were living on per year much of their work and food simply isn't counted in the economy yes i know that a lot of people in chad are dying or already dead but even more of them would be if they were truly living on per year and gnp gdp is a measure of activity not benefit so it includes the cost of cleaning up pollution putting people in jail etc even though those are really costs not benefits so it's difficult to answer your question without pinning down the exact meaning again if you want total annual income of all the people on earth it's very very roughly trillion so your guess of trillions of dollars isn't a bad guess FairTax U.S. public debt Surplus value Economy of Russia Hyperinflation Economic growth United States dollar Labor theory of value Productive and unproductive labour Economy of India Economic inequality World economy Taxation in the United States Euro Gold standard Economy of Belgium Money Arthur Laffer Flat tax Social Security (United States) Economics Monetary policy Economy of the People's Republic of China Economy of Fiji Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economy of Nigeria Pound sterling Genuine Progress Indicator Labour economics Bretton Woods system Law of value Economy of Egypt Wal-Mart Future energy development Economic history of Japan Economy of Venezuela Wealth Derivative (finance) Economy of Mexico Double counting Social Security debate (United States) Economy of Chile Asian financial crisis Growth theory Supply-side economics Economy of Macau National Kidney Foundation Singapore Economy of Papua New Guinea Economy of Romania Annuity Economy of Africa Keynesian economics Economy of Kuwait Purchasing power parity Compensation of employees Normal distribution Government debt Argentine Currency Board Economic history of Spain Economy of Colombia New Deal Value of Earth Economy of Argentina Trade Supply and demand Economy of the Central African Republic Kyoto Protocol Theory of conduct Canadian and American economies compared Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake People's Republic of China Wheel of Fortune CPU cache Bank Value added Currency Economy of Norway Insurance Interest Alcohol fuel
