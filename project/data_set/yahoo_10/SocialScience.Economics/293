i have a question regarding perfect competition i've been taking some econ classes and came across the condition of p mc price marginal cost in a perfectly competitive industry that means all the firms are making zero profit if that is the case why would the firms even continue to operate they might as well spend their time on something else thanks d you have to remember that in perfect competition there are no fixed costs so people have no investment they have to recoup and the cost of labor is included in marginal cost what price equals marginal cost refers to is that no one makes any economic profit that is no one makes anything more than the cost of the materials and their time workers can't go do something else that would make them economic profit since people could costlessly switch over to making whatever it is and if they did nothing they couldn't pay for food which is also sold at marginal cost also firms in perfect competition are just individuals producing and selling their own goods this assumption is important because if people could band together and realize economies of scale they could make economic profit compared to those doing it all themselves the people can't go do another market because they would still not be making any economic profit since the industry they went into would also be perfectly competitive people just like materials are interchangable in the perfectly competitive model and there are no differences between any markets people are earning money but they are simply being paid the value of their time so they work because they don't want to starve or be homeless or lack the other things that society regards as essential to life but they can't get amass wealth or invest Labor theory of value Capitalism Anarchism and capitalism Capital accumulation Labour economics Economics Monopoly Free trade Natural monopoly Surplus value Inflation Profit Economic inequality Perfect competition Externality Economy of Russia Prices of production Monopsony Political economy Privatization Progressive tax Tax Neoclassical economics Marginalism Gross domestic product FairTax Welfare economics Economic growth Criticisms of socialism Heckscher-Ohlin model Model (economics) Tariff Wealth Productive and unproductive labour Stackelberg competition Individualist anarchism American individualist anarchism Insurance Keynesian economics Transformation problem Commodity Minimum wage Theory of the firm Economic anthropology Labor-power Economic rent Intellectual property Organic composition of capital Price discrimination New Deal Capitalist mode of production Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Capital controversy Efficiency wages Deflation (economics) Marginal cost Great Depression Economic calculation problem Economy of the United States Principal-agent problem Unemployment Islamic banking Public good Economy of Nigeria Ford Motor Company Economy of Africa Karl Marx Cournot competition History of economic thought Constant capital History of the United States (1918-1945) Mutual fund Austrian School General equilibrium Economic history of Japan Economy of Norway Flat tax Primitive accumulation of capital Monetary policy Publicly funded medicine Anarchist economics Opportunity cost Strategic management Rational pricing Management information system Corporate finance Hyperinflation Supply-side economics Nuclear power Bertrand competition Industrial Revolution Corporation Free market Bretton Woods system Unemployment types
