sterling worldwide currency what would happen if every country in the world decided to adopt the as their national currency strictly they can't do that unilaterally ultimately the bank of england is a monopoly supplier of cash and that underpins the whole denomination of as a currency the wholesale and retail payments systems tax collection everything is dependent on that you would only get access to sterling for payments by agreement some countries achieve the same outcome via a currency board whereby they exchange their domestic currency for the foreign currency at a fixed rate always and everywhere at no cost then they can retain control of their own payments system etc but they do lose control of the supply of money in their domestic currency but lets suppose you had such agreement or currency boards everywhere the bank of england would still be the sole arbiter of the cost of via the interest rate it paid on commercial bank reserves held at the bank actually many foreign banks hold such reserves and hence sole controller of the money supply by law the monetary policy committee of the bank has to set interest rates to hit the uk's inflation target if that sole objective continued then every other country in the world would risk having the wrong level of interest money supply and corresponding economic instability to understand this you actually can see that at times within the uk that is true interest rates are only ever appropriate for a country on average different sectors different regions might prefer different levels none of that would matter if the world economy was perfectly flexible if capital and people could freely move around then the world economic cycle would join up and one level of interest rates would do but that is no where even close so economic disaster would most likely be the consequence Gold standard Money Pound sterling Money supply Hyperinflation Economy of Russia Deflation (economics) Central bank Economy of India Government debt Bank Fiat money Asian financial crisis Gross domestic product Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Keynesian economics Currency Monetarism Economy of the United States Federal Reserve Economy of Pakistan Supply-side economics Capital accumulation United States dollar Tax Supply and demand Capitalism Renminbi Economy of Nigeria U.S. public debt Free trade Economy of Ghana Bond Eurozone Economic history of Spain Law of value International Monetary Fund Comprehensive Program for Socialist Economic Integration Bank of England Economy of Argentina Economy of Chile Hong Kong dollar Economic relations of Japan Economy of Venezuela Economy of South Africa Insurance Interest Annuity Australian dollar Marshall Plan Economy of Romania Trade Economy of Papua New Guinea Credit card Devaluation East Germany Economy of Europe Economy of the Soviet Union Foreign exchange market Legal tender Fractional-reserve banking Economy of Africa Globalization Kazakhstan European System of Central Banks Great Depression Economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Economy of El Salvador European Union History of post-Soviet Russia Yield curve Monopoly Bolivia Hong Kong Monetary Authority Economy of Haiti Economy of the Philippines Taxation in the United States Mutual fund Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Economy of Sri Lanka Derivative (finance) Commodity markets Economy of Bangladesh Economy of Brazil Great Depression in the United Kingdom Arbitrage
