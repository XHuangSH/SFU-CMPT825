what is the possible employment rate of a community well technically full employment is extremely improbable and uncommon the possible potential employment rate is really the natural rate of unemployment the natural rate of unemployment consists of two types of unemployment frictional and structural frictional unemployment is unemployment that results from people being temporarily displaced from jobs they are qualified willing and able to work but they have recently been fired or quit their job for whatever reason obviously they do not find another job instantly and there is a period of time when these people are unemployed hence frictional unemployment structural unemployment is the result of structural changes in the national economy if the auto industry for example is declining there will be national firms cutting costs and closing down factories displacing workers these workers are also well qualified willing and able to work but have now been fired without true fault however they are still unemployed and so structural unemployment is still factored into the natural rate of unemployment the natural rate of unemployment is unemployment that is both plausible common and well naturally occuring it is also always present and never equal to so therefore the possible levels of employment are never greater than natural rate of unemployment at least in the long run Unemployment Unemployment types Full employment Inflation Unemployment benefit Economic inequality Underemployment Efficiency wages Working time Principal-agent problem Canadian and American economies compared Economy of Belgium Capitalism Explosive material Insurance Offshoring Economy of Russia Minimum wage Phillips curve Keynesian economics Economy of the United States Privatization Economic history of Japan Reaganomics Monopsony Compensation of employees Termination of employment Great Depression in the United Kingdom Welding Say's law Economy of Venezuela Great Depression Economy of Sweden Celtic Tiger Taxation in the United States Division of labour Education in the People's Republic of China Social Security (United States) Surplus labour Technocratic movement Exploitation Wal-Mart Tariff Economy of India Free trade Australian labour movement Economics Maritimes Economy of France Economy of Sri Lanka Economy of Haiti Economy of Pakistan Graduate school Wage slavery Capitalist mode of production Economy of the Netherlands Microeconomics Capital accumulation Current Population Survey Law of value Israeli Arab CPU cache Intelligence quotient Deficit spending Outsourcing Economic history of Canada Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Anarchism and capitalism Fire extinguisher Anarchism and society Diamond Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economy of Germany Economy of Croatia George W.
