basic economics guide anybody like to recommend a basic economics guide book you know for stuff like how banks work why recessions occur the stock market that kind of stuff mainly so i can expound a little bit on important economic related events in u s history right now i am limited to knowing that say there was a panic in but i don't necessarily know why there was a panic thanks for help i would say your better off not getting a university grade economics text as your likely to get bored first before you learn anything useful also i don t think your after need the maths just enough word economics to cover the background as i mention at the end the most import book you could read for this era circa is adam smiths wealth of nations all economics of that time is based of it modern introductory books for lay people are the best place to start there are many out there and for the most part they are exceptionally well written and enjoyable reads better than economics for dummies at any rate despite that i would recommend that teach companies audio book on economics as the best introduction as it is easier to listen than read http www teach com ttcx coursedesclong aspx cid id pc business and economics an alternative book as opposed to audio would be charles wheelan s naked economics don t let the casual wording fool you into think that he is dumbing down along with that i would recommend some background reading to get a flavour for the subject the worldly philosophers by robert heilbroner is a good introduction to the people behind the subject although it focuses a little to much on the people rather than their ideas freakonomics would be a nice read although it doesn t real cover the big macro stuff very well though reading a magazine such as the economist free articals on www economist com would help when reading anything in economics bear in mind that bias is exceptionally common for example mises org would be a good introduction but it might prejudice you against people like john maynard keynes also in economics was still very much in its infancy so modern economic thought was still in its infancy you should definitely read the wealth of nations by adam smith as for this time it was the gold standard in the subject and hugely influential also look out for works by adam smiths contemporaries the phyisocrats ricardo and malthaus would be useful background reading for thought of the time as well though it requires me to don a flam retardant suit i would also recommend some karl marx as while his conclusions are barmy as an economic historian he is first rate Economics Capitalism Liberalism Political economy Mercantilism Supply-side economics The Wealth of Nations Inflation John Maynard Keynes Labor theory of value Adam Smith Philosophy Supply and demand Gold standard History of science Monetarism Microeconomics Federal Reserve Free market Law of value Karl Marx Socialism Wealth Postmodernism Book of Mormon Modernism Socialist economics Labour economics Historical materialism Theory of conduct Immanuel Kant Capital accumulation MP3 Say's law GED Objectivist philosophy Economic growth American individualist anarchism Surplus product Productive and unproductive labour Marxism Free trade Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel History Leo Strauss A Course In Miracles Theodicy Education Property (ownership right) Great Depression Robin Hahnel Game theory Exploitation Prices of production Intelligent design Jean-Jacques Rousseau Bretton Woods system Tool (band) Macroeconomics Trade Intellectual property Gold as an investment Douglas Adams Republic Goodness and value theory Ludwig Wittgenstein Austrian School Guild David Hume Max Stirner Karl Popper Hyperinflation Philosophy of business Classical economics Guide for the Perplexed Education in the United States American Conservatism Philosophy of science Robert Heilbroner Declaration of Independence (United States) Scientology beliefs and practices Tao Te Ching Social class Unemployment Jacobo Arenas Insurance Louis Althusser
