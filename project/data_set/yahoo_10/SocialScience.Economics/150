since so many homes are in foreclosure where are those families moving too a lot of them are moving into apartments or renting houses others are moving in with friends family members until they can get their finances back in order to be able to afford a new rental it really depends on their financial status at the time they moved though if the foreclosure victims are still in trouble they'll probably have to move in with friends or family until they get a job get over their medical disability or overcome the financial hardship with little or no income they won't be able to live on their own again but some homeowners get their finances back in order and just don't have any options left to stop foreclosure these homeowners can probably begin saving up for a security deposit and start paying rent on a new apartment or house they won't be able to purchase a new house but they can find a landlord that will let them rent to own if nothing else unfortunately a number of foreclosure victims have nowhere to go and end up homeless but i would imagine this is a small percentage of homeowners but a real financial crisis can result in the inability to keep the house with no other options hope that answers your question foreclosurefish http www foreclosurefish com Housing cooperative Mortgage Insurance Rent control 401(k) Rent (musical) Great Depression Property tax Public housing Predatory lending Real estate bubble Taxation in the United States Annuity Freeters Homelessness Home insurance Leasing Apartment Renting ACORN Rental agreement Economic rent Mobile home Microeconomics Abigail Folger Leasehold estate FairTax Apartment building Parasite singles Mortgage-backed security Tax exemption Money Habitat for Humanity International Divorce Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation HyperText Transfer Protocol Unemployment Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Jack Layton Monopoly (game) Gentrification Avenue Q Harlem Deflation (economics) Kibbutz Stuyvesant Town Accounting methods Government National Mortgage Association Inflation Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Hyperinflation American Psycho Money supply Contract White flight Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Microcredit Unreformed House of Commons Timeshare Internet fraud Social Security (United States) Probation officer Mediation The Inside Warren Buffett Cosmo Kramer Progressive tax Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Interest Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Gross domestic product Karl Rove Friends Knots Landing Foreclosure Life insurance Electronic commerce Blackburn Rovers F.C.
