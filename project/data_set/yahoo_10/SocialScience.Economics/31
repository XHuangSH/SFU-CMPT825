is there some sort of a movement underway to destroy the united states economy i don't know how many of you have noticed but the price for a barrel of crude has now creeped above less than away from that until now only talked about mark with that said do you realize that if some sort of major geo political event took place and suddenly drove the price up to a barrel the u s economy would be destroyed overnight now i know the that the price we pay at the pump is largely market driven but don't these greedy b who control these markets realize that if they destroy the economy there won't be a market left for them to manipulate and furthermore do you think they even care afterall most of them have already made their millions on the backs of the everyday consumer but i guess they just want more and more huh for nc if the price for a gallon of gas would rise to even the level i'd probably have to declare bankruptcy and i suspect that there are millions of others out there in the same boat as me so what do you say to that the occam razor suggests that there is no such movement simulation modeling of a commodity market where investments are large and irreversible and the finished product is not perishable suggests that the market should behave the way it does even in the complete absence of collusion if you are good at math this could be an interesting read fridrik m baldursson modelling the price of industrial commodities economic modelling volume issue august pages abstract the theory of irreversible investment under uncertainty and the theory of competitive storage are combined in a rational expectations model of the price formation of industrial commodities in continuous time an endogenous price zone arises from the opening and closure of capacity at boundaries of the price zone dynamics of the price process within the price zone are determined by competitive speculation the model is scaled to the dimensions of the aluminium market and solved numerically simulated prices and inventories exhibit characteristics similar to the real series volatile prices asymmetric adjustment of production to price changes and long inventory cycles end of quote also before you moan about the supposedly tough life in the u s take a hard look at europe where gasoline prices on any given day are more than twice as high as they are in the u s japanese gas prices are not far behind either so if the movement you are alluding to does exist its primary targets must be europe and japan not the u s Microeconomics Supply and demand Capital accumulation Labor theory of value Keynesian economics Petroleum Law of value Free trade 1973 oil crisis Economy of the United States Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Economy of Nigeria E85 Deflation (economics) Nuclear power Hydrogen economy Commodity markets Prices of production Natural monopoly Supply-side economics Gold standard Capitalism Economy of the People's Republic of China Alcohol fuel Gasoline Hubbert peak theory Hyperinflation Economy of Japan Economic relations of Japan Economy of Russia Monetary policy Economy of Kuwait Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Economy of the United Arab Emirates Bretton Woods system Exchange value Tax Monopoly Kyoto Protocol Surplus value Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina Gross domestic product Economy of Ghana Economy of Pakistan Money Asian financial crisis Mutual fund Biodiesel Economy of Romania Euro Say's law Economy of Chile Commodity Economy of Peru Labor-power Management information system Economy of Venezuela Futures contract Hurricane Rita Carburetor Strategic management Hard disk Economy of Brazil Economy of Belgium Economy of Norway Economy of Africa Eugene Fama Economy of the Netherlands Future energy development CPU design Just In Time Heckscher-Ohlin model Karl Marx Technical analysis Economy of Germany Balassa-Samuelson effect Model (economics) Great Depression Emergence Economy of Georgia Bond Oil depletion Diamond Implications of peak oil Monetarism Neoclassical economics Solar system
