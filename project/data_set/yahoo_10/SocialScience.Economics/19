u haul over booked michiganders flooding to southern states my sister is moving to florida very soon she tried to book a u haul for this coming monday and was told that every u haul in the state of michigan was booked the owner of the u haul company then said that he has been in business for years and had never seen anything like it he also added that of the u haul rentals were people moving to georgia and florida is this a sign that michigan is slowly going under financially with tons of families flocking to better economical states what is the number of residents currently in michigan what is the number of decrease of people in the state so far i am a michigander as well i have been most of my life i am not saying everyone is leaving but for u haul to be completely over booked come on now that's crazy my sister had called multiple u haul places in michigan and no luck she is trying to get one in toledo ohio today people don't just use u hauls to move from house to house michigan has already gone under financially hence the reason why we have the biggest debt in the u s many people from michigan are just moving to a state that has more stability and a government i don't think the state has decreased in population that much just because people are leaving besides i highly doubt that a u haul company could sell out to that many people when more people are coming in the state rather than going out Michigan Interstate 75 Upper Peninsula of Michigan Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad Housing cooperative Toledo War Norfolk Southern Railway Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Michigan Territory Toledo Strip Toledo, Ohio Ohio International League State university Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Midwestern United States Great Lakes Bowl Championship Series Wayne Corporation Dearborn, Michigan Mergers and acquisitions Interstate Highway Ford Motor Company British Rail Donald Trump University of Michigan United States district court Gregg Alexander U.S. Highway 23 Canadian National Railway Democratic Party (United States) Detroit Tigers British Rail Class 42 Insurance College town U.S. public debt Hurricane Katrina timeline Highest-income places in the United States Economy of Sri Lanka British Rail Class 86 SS Edmund Fitzgerald Lower Peninsula of Michigan College rivalry Jennifer Granholm Confederate States of America Finance Chris Amon Economy of the United States Jordan Grand Prix Inflation Canadian Pacific Railway U.S. Highway 41 World Championship Wrestling FairTax Wabash Railroad Life insurance Great Lakes Storm of 1913 Buildings of Iowa State University Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) College football Michigan State University New York Central Railroad Khmer Rouge Alpha Epsilon Pi Languages in the United States Ann Arbor, Michigan Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak Delta Air Lines Florida Marlins Hurricane Wilma NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Dow Chemical Company Local access and transport area Corporation Bond Capitalism Ninety-sixth United States Congress Minor league baseball USS Waters (DD-115) Hurricane Rita Fight song Management information system Animal Crossing Ninety-fifth United States Congress BC Rail Northwest Airlines United Kingdom corporation tax Sigma Nu Georgia (U.S. state) Suburbs of Johannesburg Economy of Venezuela Boston and Lowell Railroad Chelsea F.C.
