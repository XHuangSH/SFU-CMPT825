i need an explanation for why printing money is bad for governments i'm trying to explain to my friend that the government can't just print money make everyone in the country billionaires he's having some problem understanding that money has to be backed up by something tangible like gold fish i realize there are many theories about that so just simplified examples will suffice now he can go to a farmer and try to trade the arrowheads for wheat to make bread but the farmer wants blankets not arrowheads so my friend finds a weaver and trades him arrow heads for blankets he then trades the blankets to the farmer for a certain amount of wheat now what if instead of arrowheads which are very sharp and could cut him as he carries them my friend made a note for every arrowhead he had that's notes he would write if he wrote notes he couldn't meet the demand people would be out an arrowhead the problem is that he thinks of paper money as having intrinsic value he'll understand the arrowhead example has difficulty applying it to a broad economy and probably w good cause lol perhaps if you think of it this way paper money simply facilitates the ease of trading goods and services between people there is only so much demand for all the goods and services generated in an economy so that if you suddenly start printing money you get more money chasing the same amount of goods and services this causes the value of the money to go down thereby causing the price of all goods and services to go up wealth cannot just be generated out of thin air and there is a certain equilibrium this is what we call inflation in other words the more extra money the government prints the more it devalues it's currency your friend could make everyone millionaires if he wanted to by getting the government to print all this extra money however ask him if he would would rather be a millionaire in a worthless currency or have an average amount of money in a strong currency there is no advantage to increasing your amount of money if it's buying power diminishes at an equal rate Inflation Hyperinflation Microeconomics Money Gold standard Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Fiat money Capitalism United States dollar Economics Bretton Woods system Supply and demand Keynesian economics Monetarism Gross domestic product Law of value Supply-side economics Money supply Balassa-Samuelson effect Commodity Trade Labor theory of value Capital accumulation Gold as an investment Reaganomics Banknote Currency Great Depression Economy of India Tariff Devaluation Free trade Privatization Economy of Russia Asian financial crisis Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Surplus value Exchange rate New Deal Economy of the United States Bond Intellectual property Economic history of Britain Prices of production RuneScape economy History of the United States (1918-1945) Free market Globalization Tax Unemployment Political economy International Monetary Fund Argentine Currency Board Labour economics FairTax Economy of Africa Mercantilism Economy of Colombia Model (economics) Surplus product Economy of Pakistan Canadian dollar American individualist anarchism Economy of Venezuela Transformation problem Euro Federal Reserve Roman currency Anarchist economics Productive and unproductive labour Australian dollar Economy of Mexico Gresham's law Heckscher-Ohlin model Social Credit Philippine peso Growth theory Marshall Plan Theory of conduct Yield curve Economic growth Wealth Capital controversy History of post-Soviet Russia Economy of Norway Welfare economics Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Fractional-reserve banking Purchasing power parity
