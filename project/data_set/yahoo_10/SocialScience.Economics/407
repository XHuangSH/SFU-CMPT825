does anyone else think the minimum wage raise is a horrible horrible idea seriously folks take a long hard logical economic look at it and tell me how it wouldn't hurt the economy although one might think that making employees more expensive would mean that employers higher less of them the actual effect is often too small to be measurable you might ask yourself why it is the us went through significant periods of growth with a real higher minimum wages than today it is simply not that significant also it gives owners an excuse to try to raise prices they may come to the conclusion that all similar will raise prices due to the increase in the minimum wage although this won't cause a sustain inflation as one answerer suggested it might make a few prices rise a bit and although some firms are just on the margin of breaking even and will go out of business at the slightest increase in costs many firms make short term profits and can absorb the higher labor costs there is another argument which has to do with the transfer of wealth to the poor the poor save less than the middle class or rich so a minimum wage increase stimulates overall spending which increase aggregate demand which can lead to higher growth Deflation (economics) Keynesian economics Minimum wage Unemployment Monetary policy Economic inequality Economics Gross domestic product Capitalism Wealth Monopsony Progressive tax Microeconomics Labour economics Flat tax Capital accumulation Trickle down effect Supply and demand Economic growth FairTax Free trade Unemployment types Say's law Surplus value Supply-side economics Deficit spending Privatization Law of value Reaganomics Anarchism and capitalism Efficiency wages New Deal Principal-agent problem Outsourcing Labor theory of value Phillips curve Tax Model (economics) Labor-power Economy of Russia Criticisms of socialism Wealth condensation Balassa-Samuelson effect Monetarism Economic history of Japan Arthur Laffer Gold standard Hyperinflation Business cycle Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Taxation in the United States Wal-Mart Growth theory Great Depression Capital controversy Economy of Africa Argentine Currency Board Production function Economic calculation problem American individualist anarchism Economy of Norway Socialist economics Economy of Sweden Tariff Natural monopoly Economy of the Republic of Ireland Mutual fund Aggregate demand Economy of Venezuela Working time Free market Insurance Economy of Pakistan Monopoly Exogenous growth model Theory of the firm Productive and unproductive labour History of the United States (1865-1918) History of the United States (1964-1980) Money supply Economic rent History of economic thought General equilibrium Asian financial crisis Neoclassical economics Measures of national income and output Diseconomies of scale
