fed has injected money into banks http news morningstar com external briefing html vpage indepth stockmarketupdate the fed has injected billion dollars into the markets to provide liquidity what does that mean exactly loans or what thanks to those of you that answered my question and understood that i actually knew what liquidity means but was unsure of how the government would pride the cash the fed made more money available for banks to loan out by lowering the federal funds rate it is a complicated process just trust me it works they also released more actual dollar bills into the economy making the economy more liquid liquidity is just the measure of how much actual dollar bills there are floating around in the economy too little liquidity slows the economy down too much liquidity speeds the economy up too fast most of the time of the money in the economy exists only electronically there are not enough dollar bills to go around if everyone went to the bank and took all their money out sold their stocks etc this is ok but if too many people get nervous about the economy and start to gather their cash the liquidity of the system decreases and the overall economy slows down hope this helps good luck Money supply Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Inflation Money Bank Economy of Russia Bond Federal Reserve Gold standard Euro Central bank U.S. public debt Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Mergers and acquisitions Security (finance) Microeconomics Capital accumulation Keynesian economics Tax Supply-side economics Economy of the Philippines Pound sterling Yield curve Great Depression Capitalism Economy of Nigeria United States dollar Mortgage Short selling Carburetor Arthur Laffer Argentine Currency Board Economy of India Enron Corporation Insurance FairTax Economy of Argentina Mutual fund Reaganomics Economy of Cuba Government debt Economy of Pakistan Economy of Haiti PE ratio Money market History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of the United States Credit card Fiat money Economy of El Salvador Monetarism Privatization Arbitrage Exchange rate Citigroup Economy of Sri Lanka Dot-com Financial markets Economy of Papua New Guinea Foreign exchange market Fractional-reserve banking Finance Economy of the People's Republic of China Economy of Bulgaria Marshall Plan Economy of Iceland Bank of China (Hong Kong) Fuel injection Derivative (finance) Future energy development Hydrogen economy Debt Australian dollar Hong Kong dollar Economy of Chile International Monetary Fund Money creation Life insurance Gross domestic product Economy of Suriname Student loan Microsoft Helium Microcredit Taxation in the United States Warren Buffett 2003 California recall Economy of Ghana Islamic banking Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
