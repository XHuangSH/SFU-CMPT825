tariffs how do they work i understand that tariffs are a tax on imported goods but that's about all i understand do foreign countries have to pay us more money in order to sell their goods here or is the price s of the foreign goods sold here raised if a tariff was put on a certain product foreign product and the u s sold the exact same product how much of a difference in price would there be i also have another question that pertains to this i know that tariffs are put on foreign goods in order to encourage citizens of this country to buy domestic goods why doesn't the government just not allow certain foreign countries to sell their stuff here i know it's a dumb question but i'm just really confused and have been for a long time about the tariff thing please help tariffs work by forcing the exporter to pay additional taxes to the government in order to import the good into the country these costs then get passed along to the consumer in the form of higher prices so yes foreign countries have to pay the government to allow their goods into the country and consumers pay more in order to buy the imported goods tariffs generally tend to raise the price of all products that have the tariff on them whether they are foreign or domestic foreign firms pass on the cost of the tariff to their customers as much as they can and this allows domestic firms to either sell more here at a lower price or increase the price of their goods to match keeping the difference for themselves so it is hard to say how much a tariff would increase the price of goods because there are a number of different variables at play certainly the price would go up by no more than the tariff amount since if any firm did this both domestic and foreign competitors could undercut their prices in fact in the long term tariffs could actually bring the price down by encouraging domestic production while protecting it from competition eventually or so the theory goes once the domestic producers are strong enough to compete then the government could drop the tariffs and let everyone compete on a level playing field the u s in theory believes in the free market and to ban legal foreign products would certainly be challenged in court so it is easier to simply apply tariffs to imported goods than to outright ban them most imported goods do not have a perfect substitute so to ban products would cause a backlash from the public while in some cases tariffs may be useful to promote certain industries they are very costly to the economy the supply of product is reduced and the price is increased resulting in the demand being less than what the market would supply at a given price Monopoly Tax Economics Inflation Capitalism Agricultural policy Monetary policy Keynesian economics Deflation (economics) Privatization Supply-side economics Labour economics Gold standard Natural monopoly Bretton Woods system Common Agricultural Policy Great Depression Hyperinflation Economy of India History of international trade Globalization FairTax Externality Economy of the United States Economy of Chile Value added tax Mercantilism U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement Minimum wage Public good Political economy Balassa-Samuelson effect Subsidy Law of value Ford Motor Company Canadian and American economies compared Labor-power Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Commodity Economic relations of Japan Publicly funded medicine Capital accumulation Economy of Pakistan Airline Progressive tax Economic growth History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of South Africa Fair trade Competition Health insurance Illegal drug trade History of the United States (1789-1849) Heckscher-Ohlin model Insurance Asian financial crisis Prices of production American individualist anarchism Black market Food and Drug Administration Advertising Surplus value Economy of Nigeria Mutual fund Economy of Cuba Famine Japan-United States relations Economy of Belgium Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economy of Colombia Economy of Poland Intellectual property Trade and development Free market Public policy Outsourcing Economy of Romania Taxation in the United States Great Depression in the United Kingdom Bond Economic history of Spain Economy of Norway Productive and unproductive labour Growth theory Perfect competition Adam Smith General equilibrium
