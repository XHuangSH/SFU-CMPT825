labor unions what are they all about they serve as a mediator of interest between members and those who employ them typically unions are seen as the antithesis of the 'corporation' often referring to that age old golden rule 'ye who owns the gold makes the rules' thus labour unions are seen to provide a necessary counter balance to the concentration of corporate power vested in employment decision makers edms if unions work for workers who do they work against just as workers and their bosses don't always see eye to eye shareholders and edms aren't always acting in unison either in business school this disharmony is known as principal agent discord ie when the edm is not behaving as the shareholder would in certain situations this 'misalignment of agenda' is usually derived from and perpetuates unclear financail planning or poor ongoing financial measurement and it serves to maximise edm utility over and above the rewards allocated to managers' by shareholders according to profit productivity customer satisfaction etc such 'imperfect' information between edms employees and shareholders is called a market failure in the economic sense unions therefore are required to provide a collective means of overcoming the market failure caused by the natrual human instincts of edm representitives to discretely or otherwise 'feather the nest' of self interst however corporations are not alone in their battle against this principle agent discord unions too have a concentration of power that must be managed and this usually lies within the union decision makers udms who are just as suceptable to conflicting personal and official intersts despite the near perfect alighnment of both worker and shareholder interests in the long run hence we have the frustraions that each view each other udms workers blame edms corporations for poor employment engagement when shareholders typicllly want the same thing as the work force ie productive employees and on the other hand edms put blame on unions for archaic use of labour over more efficient capital etc etc etc and so edms and udms play shareholders union members off one another to boost non production orrientated goals overpopulated headcounts which leads to lower productivity and lower pay for a greater number of union subscribing employees but larger management membership bonuses for edms udms alike so in shortened form unions are an imperfect force to counteract the principal agent discord between shareholders and corporate management designed by their nature to dilute the concentration of imperfectly administered economic power decision making away from management and towards an otherwise diluted body of members employees update we outsiders do trust that there is a great deal of knowledge within groups such as owners managers shareholders and customers unfortunately there is also a gap between the actions of one and the effect on the other managers are managing on behalf of the owners and controlling the employees the employees 'serve' the management and control the quality of the products or the customer experience in the short term etc customers control then the success of the owners without directly rewarding the workers tipping in restruarants is a direct attack on this problem and can be relied upon to seek their own interests efficiently enough given a choice ie that the company is not a monopoly we know from america's democracy passion that a misalignment of servitude feedback and control leads to hedgemony the magnitude of the feedback control inefficiency dictates the propensity to create a centralisation of power and in a perfect economy market there is no need for the centralisation of power at all economies of scale considered so we trust the owners to make good decisions on what rewards them profitability we trust managers to make good decisions that reward them bureaucractic security dirty word or not workers to reward them longevity and customers based on their rewards the problem and need for unions imperfect as they are arises when the workforce is stuck between the consumer is king and the executive is power as generally workers have no direct link to the choices in the output they make to the consumer or to the peolpe who actually emplyoy them the shareholder hence unions collect them together and bargain for workers rights although usually to the detriment of the owner and the customer and so ultimately against the worker himself the problem rests with the people charged with managing the mismanagement of information Monopoly Labour economics Supply and
