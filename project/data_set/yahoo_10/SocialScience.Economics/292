how do i determine certain popular currency quotes how do i determine certain popular currency quotes for example the exchange rate of gbp and usd is normally gbp usd the exchange rate of aud and usd is normally aud usd however the exchange rate of sgd and usd is normally usd sgd so i want to know the popular currency quotes for the following exchange rate pairs aud and gbp eur and aud nzd and gbp eur and nzd gbp and eur thank you that's a good question there is a hierarchy in ranking currencies there is some logic involved but the ranking is mostly traditional in the forex market the world's most important currency was traditionally prior to wwii the british pound therefore the gbp was always placed first in currency pairs ie gbp usd when the u s became the world's most important country after wwii the cross was never changed to usd gbp gbp usd is still used exclusively some british dominions were so closely linked to the u k that their currencies also took precedence in pairs such as aud usd and nzd usd this was despite the fact that australia's and new zealand's economies were not even comparable in size to the u s you will almost never see usd nzd quoted in the forex market in the market the canadian dollar is always quoted as usd cad but at the consumer level it is often quoted the other way around as cad usd when the euro came into existence it was decided that since it was the national currency of many wealthy powerful developed countries such as france germany and italy it should take precedence even over the british pound and the us dollar therefore the euro pound cross is quoted as eur gbp not gbp eur and it is eur usd to answer your other pairs they are gbp aud eur aud gbp nzd eur nzd you might find them quoted in reverse in local newspapers or on local tv but those are the official pairs Pound sterling Canadian dollar Foreign exchange market CFA franc Exchange rate New Zealand dollar New Turkish lira Australian dollar Real (currency) Eurozone Jamaican dollar Argentine peso Table of historical exchange rates Romania Uruguayan peso Mexican peso Indian Rupee Norwegian krone Philippine peso Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
