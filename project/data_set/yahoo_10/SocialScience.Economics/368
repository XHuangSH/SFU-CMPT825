why is the us dollar falling against all other major currencies since the last couple of years is it due to policies of the us govt to decrease the large trade deficit or some other reason actually what i want t know is what specific policies are being followed by the us to devalue its currency is is printing excess dollars or money market intervention by the fed reserve or something else also the obvious way to repay federal deficits trade deficits is to devalue the currency owed this way they don't have to raise taxes or appear to cut spending since they can just put an inflation tax on the entire population the anger at chinese currency manipulation is based on our politicians being upset that the chinese have bought more and more dollars driving up demand and price for usd artificially undervaluing the yuan is the same thing as artificially overvaluing the dollar its a long way down well international demand plays a huge part in the value of the product deficits of all types reduce investor demand don't want to buy into a company that lives off the credit card low interest rates reduce demand obviously they continue to increase the supply at a rapid pace they use 'tough talk' with the chinese to decrease their demand when they say let the yuan float they're really saying let the dollar fall so its a combination of government spending patterns consumer spending patterns diplomacy and monetary policy there are probably other mechanisms that i'm not thinking of too oh yeah gdp growth is sluggish some estimates say we'll be beat by japan and the eu for the first time in a long time when it comes to economic growth as a of gdp this also reduces demand in american backed assets equities and therefor reduces demand for dollars another thing thats unrelated to any of our policies is the world currency reserves have already been mostly built up in dollars with the eu proving a viable alternative those government money managers are looking to diversify their savings by selling dollars and buying euros until they reach a safer balance the more you diversify an investment the less likely you are to lose money and the last few years have been the first chance for people to diversify into a third currency as strong as the yen or dollar well there's also the international oil markets they've been denominated in dollars for a long time and that increases demand for dollars you need dollars to be in the market profiting off that industry some oil producers are switching to a euro based market and this has the effect of increasing demand for euros Bank Economy of Belgium Economy of Nigeria Economic relations of Japan Government debt Economic history of Spain Bond Great Depression Economy of Brazil PE ratio Free trade Economy of Colombia Money Deficit spending 1973 oil crisis Capitalism Economy of Venezuela FairTax Economy of Suriname History of the United States (1980-1988) Fiat money Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Economy of the European Union Foreign exchange market Devaluation Australian dollar Economy of El Salvador Economy of Argentina International Monetary Fund Currency Economy of Cuba Economy of Africa Canadian and American economies compared Social Security debate (United States) Tariff Privatization Economics History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of Senegal Economy of Hungary Tax Economy of Guyana Economy of South Africa Economy of Brunei Economy of the Netherlands Arbitrage Progressive tax Interest Economy of Macau Economy of Lebanon Romania Security (finance) George W.
