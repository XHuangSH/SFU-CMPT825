animals in america have a higher standard of living than humans in other countries isn't that disgusting what do you think i personally think it is abhorrent how so many people buy little toys and clothes for their pets when there are people out there who aren't having their basic needs food and shelter met not saying that if ppl stopped doing this that we would solve world poverty but doesn't this stuff disturb you it disturbs me as it is an example of how disconnected we become from our actions as the world keeps getting smaller if everyone did stop buying cutesy things for their pets someone in a developing nation might well lose their job so that action may not be the wisest course but the way that the couple of bucks you spend on a chew toy is divided is a real problem it's usually the middlemen who end up taking a lot of the profit of offshore made goods avenues like 'fair trade' agricultural goods or stores like villages are a way around this disparity for a small percentage of those in developing countries promised but not enacted aid packages like the millennium development goals should also be realized such actions and aid is not only for those people 'over there' but is in our own best interests failed states are everyone's problem peace Free trade Poverty W.
