how does the median voter theory affect economics on a macro level what economic expectations do you have as an informed voter economist often use the hot dog stand example to illustrate the effects of this theory on economic policy suppose that we have a long beautiful beach with lots of sun bathers scattered along that beach a hot dog vendor shows up and wants to pick the best location for her business where should she locate the answer is that she should locate herself in the exact middle of the beach which minimizes the walking distance for all possible consumers now suppose that a second hot dog vendor shows up at the same beach where should he locate the answer is right next to the first vendor he will take all the customers to one side of the beach and the first vendor will take all the other customers what does this have to do with politics politicians will locate near the middle of all issues if the median voter theorem is correct this means that there will be no serious differences on economic issues assuming that voters are distributed evenly along the political spectrum however the world is more complicated than the assumptions in the theorem there are many political issues and voters are often lumped in certain segments pro life or pro choice for example Economics Single Transferable Vote Microeconomics Bayes' theorem Bayesian inference Labor theory of value Democracy Bell's theorem Liberal Democrats (UK) Normal distribution Wealth Keynesian economics G__del's incompleteness theorem Prior probability Supply and demand Voter turnout ELO rating system Arrow's impossibility theorem Insurance Model (economics) Determinism Political economy Outsourcing Tactical voting Land use forecasting Bulk vending Inflation Halting problem Many-worlds interpretation Welfare economics Probability Liberalism Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Labour economics Contract Big Bang General equilibrium EPR paradox Politics of the United States Software engineering Economic inequality Free trade Transformation problem Modified Newtonian dynamics Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Logic Politics of the United Kingdom Prices of production Annuity Democratic Party (United States) Self-adjoint operator Ethics Monty Hall problem Instant-runoff voting Public choice theory Left-wing politics Axiom of choice Linear regression Black hole Propositional calculus Natural monopoly Institution Energy development Kolmogorov complexity Gravity Natural deduction Complexity classes P and NP David Levy (Israeli politician) Political spectrum Business ethics Kenneth Arrow Neoclassical economics Microsoft Random walk Price discrimination General relativity Tariff Social Security debate (United States) Mathematician Privatization Carl Friedrich Gauss Rational expectations Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Gerrymandering Geocoding Property (ownership right) U.S. Electoral College Sampling (statistics) Monetary policy Lebesgue integration Mathematical model Australian electoral system 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Referendum Interpretation of quantum mechanics Heckscher-Ohlin model Precautionary principle Redundant array of independent disks
