what is lras the long run average cost curve depicts the per unit cost of producing a good or service in the long run when all inputs are variable the curve is created as an envelope of an infinite number of short run average total cost curves the envelope is based on the point of each short run atc curve that provides the lowest possible average cost for each quantity of output the lrac curve is u shaped reflecting economies of scale when negatively sloped and diseconomies of scale when positively sloped in the long run when all factors of production can be changed the scale of the enterprise can be increased in this case productive efficiency occurs at the optimum scale of output where all the possible economies of scale have been enjoyed and the firm is not large enough to experience diseconomies of scale this at output level q in the diagram Production function Microeconomics Labour economics Returns to scale Supply and demand Marginal cost Profit maximization Externality Welfare economics Natural monopoly Production possibility frontier Monopoly Inflation Production, costs, and pricing Diseconomies of scale Price discrimination Prices of production Operational amplifier Management information system Strategic management Exogenous growth model Cournot competition Deflation (economics) Aggregate supply Monopsony Free trade Keynesian economics Social cost Law of value Neoclassical economics Diminishing returns Action potential Loudspeaker Perfect competition Model (economics) Capitalism Economics Opportunity cost Commodity Aggregate demand Gross domestic product Fuel injection Hydrogen economy Future energy development Temperature Unemployment Value added tax Jet engine Heckscher-Ohlin model Yield curve Derivative Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Surplus value Trigonometric function Privatization Climate change Capital accumulation Electronic amplifier Discrete Fourier transform Nuclear fusion Tariff Air traffic control Monetary policy Bertrand competition Criticisms of socialism Normal distribution Oscilloscope Fusion power Geographic information system Hubbert peak theory Phillips curve Explosive material Principal-agent problem Solar power satellite Wind power Profit Diode Grade (education) Welding Monopolistic competition Vacuum tube Curve fitting Productive and unproductive labour PID controller Internal ballistics Amplitude modulation Transformation problem Infinity Biodiesel Solar cell Economic inequality
