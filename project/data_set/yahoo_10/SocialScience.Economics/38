economics help i have an economics exam tonight i am studying for and will have a question similar to this one i am lost on this can someone help i cant figure out how to draw the graphs on the computer either which we will do in class here is the example question p g and the purex co meet in vegas to form a laundry detergent cartel a illustrate graphically how the cartel would be administered regarding price and output b do you think this laundry cartel would be stable c the westport company decides to manufacture laundry detergent and is invited to join the cartel how would this very efficient producer affect the cartel agreement modify your cartel graph to show the change well it's difficult to draw graphs in this little answer box so i will forego that and instead try to offer you some helpful suggestions a cartels operate just like monopolies they try to maximize profits the profit maximizing price and quantity comes at the output level where marginal revenue mr equals marginal cost mc market equilibrium the intersection of the supply and demand curves always occurs at the perfect competition solution where price p equals mc the monopoly solution will always be at a higher price and lower quantity than the competitive solution note the curves do not shift b cartels are theoretically extremely unstable why first of all they are illegal that means leaving a paper trail is very unwise and so most occurances of cartels involve under the table deals and or verbal contracts obviously these illegal contracts are not legally binding as a result each firm in a cartel has great economic incentive to undercut its partners a small amount with a lower price and steal the entire market share thus taking all of the profits one can see however that if this continued eventually both firms would undercut each other until they reached the point where p mc which is the competitive solution and the cartel has essentially been destroyed c naturally an efficient producer has lower costs than its competitors implying a lower marginal cost this will in turn change where the monopolistic solution of mr mc is also having a lower cost be a part of the cartel shifts the supply curve to the right as well as the monopolistic quantity i believe however that the price of the cartel will still remain the same but profits will be higher with the lower cost Price discrimination Externality Monopsony Inflation Keynesian economics Privatization Capitalism Profit maximization Tariff Illegal drug trade Cournot competition Economics Production function Bertrand competition Welfare economics Free trade Law of value Stackelberg competition Monetary policy Efficiency wages Prices of production Tax Model (economics) Labor theory of value Profit Monopolistic competition Public good Neoclassical economics Progressive tax Coercive monopoly Incentive Principal-agent problem Opportunity cost Perfect competition Oligopoly American individualist anarchism Phillips curve Transformation problem Supply-side economics Airline Anarchism and capitalism Criticisms of socialism Capital controversy Predatory pricing Surplus value Production theory basics FairTax Experience curve effects Free market Economic growth Commodity Economy of Russia Gold standard Contract Hubbert peak theory Theory of the firm Trade union Arbitrage Competition Production possibility frontier Intellectual property AMD Enzyme Strategic management Economic history of Britain Outsourcing Nuclear fusion Dynamical system DVD Exchange value Antitrust Collusion Nuclear power Reaganomics Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Space elevator Management information system Labor-power Future energy development Internal ballistics Glossary of graph theory Government-granted monopoly Exogenous growth model United States Postal Service Wal-Mart
