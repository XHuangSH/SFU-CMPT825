why is it that a closed economy can have goods market equilibrium and yet have a large degree of unemployment using the keynesian model well my guess would be that because there are no external factors influencing the closed economy's aggregate supply and demand like international imports and exports the economy can usually have a pretty steady equilibrium but because there are no imports and exports and the shipping industry is a huge industry there are fewer job opportunities thus creating a higher unemployment rate Economics Microeconomics Inflation Supply and demand Unemployment Aggregate demand General equilibrium Gross domestic product Bretton Woods system Labor theory of value Minimum wage Neoclassical economics Neo-Keynesian Economics IS/LM model Gold standard Great Depression in the United Kingdom Economy of the United States Say's law Law of value Capitalism Monetarism Reaganomics Austrian School Model (economics) Deflation (economics) Macroeconomics Phillips curve Monetary policy Economic growth Growth theory Economy of Russia Economic inequality Economic history of Canada Economy of Japan Free trade Rational expectations Economy of Venezuela Economy of India Economy of Pakistan History of the United States (1918-1945) Free market Economic equilibrium Business cycle Canadian and American economies compared Mercantilism Economy of Colombia Economy of Sri Lanka Economy of Africa Aggregate supply Progressive tax Economy of Senegal Industrial Revolution Economy of Taiwan Trickle down effect Economic history of Spain Hydrogen economy Capital accumulation Economy of Haiti Economy of the Philippines Economy of Argentina Subsidy World economy Economy of Norway Great Depression Economy of Malta Monopsony Economy of Fiji Economy of Israel Supply-side economics Underemployment Economy of Germany Prices of production Economy of the Netherlands Economy of Sweden Economy of Cuba Economy of C__te d'Ivoire Economy of Chile Economy of New Zealand Economy of Ecuador Economy of Egypt Economy of Nicaragua Economy of Paraguay Economy of Iceland Tax Economy of Armenia Efficiency wages Deficit spending Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Economy of Italy Economy of Slovakia Post-Keynesian economics Economy of France Economy of Macau
