describle the credibility problems that arise in the non subgame perfect equilibria equilibrium outcomes look identical with the subgame perfect one they entail the same payoffs for each othe the players but they arise after different combinations of strategies how this can happen thx in advance it's nash equilibrium strategy theory applied on a smaller scale a subgame when a subgame has nash equilibrium whereas the payoffs are the same for all players then that subgame has subgame perfect equilibrium essentially it's not suggested that subgame perfect equilibrium is continuous there may be only a few instances of subgame perfect equilibrium so long as strategies change the chances of repetitive subgame perfect equilibrium are low Subgame perfect equilibrium Game theory Extensive form game Solution concept Nash equilibrium Stackelberg competition Ultimatum game Backward induction Game of chicken Best response Signaling games Evolutionarily stable strategy Microeconomics Slot machine Surreal number Glossary of game theory Supply and demand Payoff matrix Blackjack Action potential Membrane potential Free market General equilibrium Stag hunt Experience curve effects Poker Dynamical system Paradox Temperature Cheap talk Poker jargon Reinhard Selten Entropy Heckscher-Ohlin model Bertrand competition Newcomb's paradox Model (economics) Keynesian economics Prices of production Efficiency wages Law of value Monopoly Emergence John Forbes Nash Mutual assured destruction Cournot competition Labor theory of value Big Bang Craps Phillips curve Zero-sum Neoclassical economics Minimax Determinacy SubSpace (computer game) Punctuated equilibrium Rational expectations Economics Gaia philosophy Video poker Rare Earth hypothesis Capital controversy Water (molecule) Nuclear fusion Monopsony Phonon Institution Species Enzyme Cooperative game Strategic management Folk theorem (game theory) Gambling Macroevolution Chemistry Gaia theory (science) Meaning Twenty One (game show) Pretty Good Privacy Thermodynamics Chess Chemical reaction Statistical mechanics Tariff Kenneth Arrow Self-organization Corporate finance Coriolis effect Military strategy Randomness Route assignment Capitalism Immortality Phase (matter) Go (board game) Atomism Torque
