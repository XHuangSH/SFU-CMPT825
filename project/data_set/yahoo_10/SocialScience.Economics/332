why in many jobs does it seem the lower one's position the harder one's work i don't think she meant harder as in more physically challenging i've been in jobs where the entry level positions have the more mentally challenging jobs as well the days where specialists were promoted are over talent won't ever make you a manager many companies don't even allow people to become managers and hire people directly to managerial positions straight out of college because they were business administration or psychology majors or had previous management experience management of people is a trade in itself and managers and administrators shouldn't be looked at as being above you so much as they are in a different line of work people in higher positions do honestly have simpler day to day tasks the trade off is that they're accountable for the actions of everyone in lower positions when you do something wrong they do something wrong even if they could do nothing to prevent it it's actually scary having people working for you that know ten times as much about their job as you do and a good manager knows the way to earn the respect of their employees is to focus on the administrative aspects of their job give their employees the room and materials they need to do their job and keep everyone else out of their way a good manager isn't a slave driver he's the guy that makes it possible for everyone else to do what they're good at all that said the other benefit to not being a manager is that once you're experienced and skilled enough you can work for whoever will pay you the most money and the few bad managers out there that are full of themselves aren't your problem anymore get good enough at what you do and you can triple their salary and feel good about yourself because you did it the hard way Unemployment Theory of conduct Outsourcing Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action Corporate governance The nature of God in Western theology Capitalism Division of labour Procrastination Economics Game programmer American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Strategic management Scientology beliefs and practices Transactional analysis Microeconomics Graduate school Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Inflation Offshoring Final Fantasy XI Baseball Minimum wage Enron Corporation Economic inequality Extreme Programming Arturo Frondizi Wal-Mart Air traffic controller Productive and unproductive labour Labour economics Toronto Raptors Social rule Professor New Deal Monetary policy Workplace democracy Tariff Gross domestic product Efficiency wages Social Security (United States) Health insurance Sweatshop Principal-agent problem Volleyball Labor-power Salary Martial art Keynesian economics Newcastle United F.C. 401(k) Anarchism and capitalism Chess strategy and tactics Professional wrestling slang Tai Chi Chuan Arguments for and against drug prohibition Capital accumulation Economy of Africa Windows XP Plame affair Insurance Israeli Arab MMORPG Master of Business Administration Vicente Fox Anarchism and society Unemployment benefit Guild Redundant array of independent disks Exploitation Intelligence quotient Electronic commerce Credit card Great Depression Customer relationship management W.
