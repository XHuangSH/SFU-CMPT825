why does usa export goods to japan provide economic reasons please in the simplest sense nations trade for similiar reasons why states counties cities individuals and even you trade it appears to make you and the seller better off i buy shoes from china because they are the cheapest at the best price even if i make bicycles and shoes better than you it pays for me to make bicycles and you to make shoes because then i can make more bicycles which i make relatively better this is the idea of comparative advantage this idea assumes that for some reason one person is better at something than another as if we were a little nation of idiosyncratic shopkeepers with inherent skills and artistic flair in reality information can be bought and sold and except for high tech goods most goods could be made by most people in most countries so unless a country restricts trade the jobs will go to those with the lowest wages it so happens that we subsidize our farm exports and i think this is our main export to japan japan actually does make cars better than the us and in order to sell their cars which they subsidize i think they buy our goods so to answer your question in a long winded way the reason why usa exports goods to japan is in part due to comparative advantage and in part due to government regulation Free trade Microeconomics Law of value Supply and demand Capitalism Inflation Gross domestic product Minimum wage Trade Economics Bretton Woods system Tariff Capital accumulation Great Depression Protectionism Tax Japan-United States relations Gold standard Subsidy Agricultural policy Economy of the United States Corporation Measures of national income and output Utility cycling Economy of Mexico Arbitrage Heckscher-Ohlin model Neoliberalism Externality Hyperinflation Canadian and American economies compared U.S. public debt Offshoring Price discrimination Monetary policy Social Credit Asian financial crisis Economy of Fiji Sweatshop Economy of Singapore Economy of Belgium Scientology beliefs and practices Anarchism and capitalism Economy of Chile Monopsony Economy of Cuba Financial markets Health insurance Economy of Colombia Economy of Norway History of international trade United States Shrimp farm Economy of Venezuela Publicly funded medicine Monopoly Deflation (economics) Labor-power Yugo Slavery Stock market Value added tax Ford Motor Company FairTax Strategic management Productive and unproductive labour Economy of Europe Kyoto Protocol Intellectual property Airline Economy of Bolivia Exploitation Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Contract Economy of Switzerland Recumbent bicycle Mercantilism Economy of Taiwan Technology Classified information Unemployment Commodity American individualist anarchism State Filling station Internet fraud ITunes Music Store Economy of Rwanda Surplus value Sugar Toyota Camry Bicycle lighting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Romania
