globalization i'm conducting a survey for school and hope maybe you can help i need to show a survey of how many are for globalization and how many against it please also include why or why not thanks in advance ah here we go the beauty of adam smith's invisible hand over the market place is that no transaction ever occurs unless both sides profit from the situation globalization and outsourcing jobs benifits everyone involved there is no looser in economics for example when nike outcources its shoe making jobs to india everyone benifits the people in india are obviously making more money there than they could anywhere else because if not then they would not have chosen to work there even though the wages seem low to us by their standards they are very high because if they were not then nike would find noone willing to work for them period its just logic oh and even child labor in rd world countries is good because studies have shown that if they were not working for nike they would likely be child prostitutes or something similar they would not magically go to school rather than working if we stopped hiring children they would just find other jobs much worse ones most likely now people might think that the thousands of jobs overseas are taking away from americans who need the jobs well that may be true but if you look at the bigger picture even those people are benifiting because they can now buy cheeper shoes and are in a way earning money by not having to spend as much on shoes and the few lost jobs here benifits more people in america than it hurts globalization allows for specialization in trade which is very very good even if america is better at producing both computers and shoes than say india is everyone still benifits from trade america can have the workers in india who are not as skilled making shoes and have the people who are more skilled with computers spending their time making computers rather than shoes i hate for this to be too long but you can apply any other anti globalization theory to this logic and you will see that everyone benifits from globalization or else it simply would not occur you must look at the big picture that is adam smith's invisibal hand in action i hope this helps you Unemployment Capitalism Outsourcing Sweatshop Free trade Economic inequality Economics Inflation Supply and demand Great Depression Division of labour Trade Labor theory of value Exploitation Trade union Capital accumulation History of economic thought Microeconomics Commodity Labour economics Wal-Mart Law of value Anarchism and capitalism Keynesian economics Principal-agent problem Globalization Nike, Inc.
