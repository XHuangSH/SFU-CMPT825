why dont baptists dance i am a baptist i have been teaching children in the sunday school for years i am also a full time dance instructor in ballroom and latin dances see so about the baptists its hard to put them all in one category cause they are a diverse society but mainly they are more likely to be conservative or somewhere in the middle there are much more conservative church denominations they step firmly on the bible every local church usually decides their own issues in the way they think its appropriate for them i remember what a scandal it was when our youth group first put the drums in the hall of the church all the old traditional ladies ware offended and ready to defend christ to death hopefully our pastors were thought full men and within a year nobody could imagine a worship service without the drums so be patient with people's prejudice and if it is important to you to dance and you're a baptist then you better pray if not hope you learned a little more about our baptist christian society which is often very friendly dynamic and progressive Church of Christ Southern Baptist Convention Religious Society of Friends John the Baptist Christian denomination Roman Catholic Church Christianity Baptism Reformed Baptist History of Christianity Sabbath Lutheranism Methodism Christian-Jewish reconciliation Catechism Plymouth Brethren Minister of religion Catholicism New Testament Restorationism Independent Baptist Protestantism Evangelicalism Eucharist Homosexuality and Christianity Mission (Christian) Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Mainline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints A Course In Miracles Richard Allen (reverend) Christian right Traditionalist Catholic Clergy Megachurch Church of Christ, Scientist Religious pluralism Priesthood (Mormonism) Liberal Christianity Bible and reincarnation Opus Dei Glossary of partner dance terms Sola fide Primitive Baptist Mary, the mother of Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church Schwarzenau Brethren Anglicanism Holy Orders John Wesley Charles Grandison Finney Music genre Elder (religious) William Carey Unitarianism Millerites Reformed churches United Church of Christ Ballroom dance Brethren Mormonism and Christianity Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith Tony Campolo Christian theological controversy Charles Darwin's views on religion Religion in Japan Dispensationalism Presbyterianism R.
