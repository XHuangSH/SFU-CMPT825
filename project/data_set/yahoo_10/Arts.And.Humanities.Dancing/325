excuse my salsa ignorance what really is the difference between on and on i know on is west coast and on is east but quite literally what do you do different and are the two different enough that if i don't know on and go to the east coast will i not be able to dance if someone asks again forgive my ignorance i have only been dancing salsa a short while and i am learning on the west coast so i guess i am learning on it's not entirely accurate to say that only the west coast dances on and only the east coast dances on or new york style on henceforth 'nyon ' i've found that on on and ny on are danced throughout the country i believe on to be the most popular timing used with nyon closing in fast and on a distant third see further below for a description of the basic step on these different timings besides the difference in timing which i believe may be your biggest hurdle what you will encounter is that there are several different styles of salsa as well in other words different timing doesn't necessarily make for a difference in style i categorize these different styles as follows ballroom colombian cuban la and new york however in the context of your question i will assume that you are referring to la style and new york style these are the differences between those two styles as i see them la mainly danced on but can also be danced on or ny on sharpness speed and precision are usually associated with this style it's a bit on the coarse side and it's known for incorporating lots of flashy dips and tricks if you frequent salsa clubs in la i'm sure you can attest to the fact that you'll see neck drops and the occasional girl getting flipped this is a great performance style but also a good social style of salsa la style is the most popular style worldwide this doesn't necessarily mean it's the best in the us it's obviously most popular in and around la but also throughout the rest country at the moment i would say that it's more popular than new york style in the us a few years back i would have said that it's definitely more popular but through the advent of salsa congresses new york style has surged in popularity and has caught up new york mainly danced nyon but also danced on or on this style is defined by smooth flowing motion with lots of personal style and body movement this is a great social style but also a good performance style of salsa good new york style dancers float around the floor while doing their turn patterns and shines this style obviously is most popular in and around nyc and the northeast of the us but as mentioned before it has surged in popularity throughout the country and is gradually gaining popularity in europe and other parts of the world as well timing on basic step the leader 'rocks' or 'breaks' forward with the left foot on count of the count steps in place with the right foot on count brings the left foot a half step behind the right on count holds on count rocks back with the right foot on count steps in place with the left foot on count brings the right foot a half step in front of the left foot on count and holds count on basic step aka power on or palladium style on the leader holds count rocks back with the right foot on count steps in place with the left foot on count brings the right foot a half step in front of the left on count holds on count rocks forward with the left foot on count steps in place with the right foot on count and brings the left foot a half step behind the right on count notice that the steps are identical to on except for the difference in timing you may also find that on is danced with the same foot pattern but the timing reversed such that the leader rocks forward on instead of nyon basic step leader brings left foot a half step behind the right on rocks back with the right foot on steps in place with the left foot on holds on brings right foot a half step in front of the left on rocks forward with the left foot on steps in place with the left foot on and holds on notice the difference in your foot position when you're doing the hold in puerto rico this foot pattern is used but the timing reversed such that the leader rocks forward on instead of as far as these styles are concerned they are constantly influencing each other so gradually the distinction between them become less and less obvious and you'll end up with a style that encompasses elements of both in fact the style of on that you're learning probably has some new york influences to explain this more clearly i'll offer you an example i'm an avid salsa dancer and have been for years i can dance either on on or nyon but i know that my style is predominantly new york because it's where i'm from when i switch from dancing nyon to on i don't pull out a whole new set of turn patterns or change my body movement or my shines i just change the timing so even though their will be some differences in the styles between the west and east coast your biggest hurdle is overcoming the difference in timing if you've trained your ears and body to listen for and react to the ' ' then dancing nyon will take some getting used but you don't have to start from scratch you just have to get used to the adjustment in timing West Coast Swing Lindy Hop Contredanse Professional wrestling holds Side pass (dance move) Music genre Skateboarding trick Charleston
