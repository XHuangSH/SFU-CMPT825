so you think you can dance who do you want to win personally i want pasha to win for those who wonder why i want pasha to win it's becuse first of all he is verry versital he danced beautifluly to every kind of style so far the only other person who come rometly close to that is neil but neil doesn't 'get into the part' as well as pasha does he always has the same look on his face in every dance i have to admit danny is good at ballet but thats it he always dances the same exact way the best dancer out of the girls is deffenetly sabra but she doesn't preform as gracefully as she should the other two girls blend in they just don't have what it takes to stand out and just because neil had one amazing preformance doesnt mean that he should win its about being the best throughout the entire season and im not just talking about the emotions in his face im talking about his attitude in general which has remained constant through the whole show krissy you seem to misunderstand the concept behind dance it is not all about technicality it is about overall performance connecting both the technical steps to the emotion while neil has excels technically he has only recently started to emit emotion but not enough that he is really giving a great performance same way with danny best technically but also until recently danced with no emotion pasha however is not the best technically he still out performs both of them the same was the case last season with travis and benji benji out performed travis plain and simple as far as the girls lauren seems to falter both technically and emotionally i think lacey and sabra will most likely be the top two but from there it could really go either way depending on the final performances i agree that silly faces and over expression in the face is often a problem something that has also plagued cheerleading as well i too have danced over years and have been teaching for and have found that i express myself best through dance too i find that most in the past weeks i have noticed quite an improvement in both danny and neil which is why i said until recently in the previous paragraph of neil and danny's performances have been vacant of emotion even from the eyes your right emotion doesn't have to mean silly faces or such and no i don't like overacting either and yes i agree that emotion can be felt everywhere in the body but they didn't seem to show it at all i also agree with you about the mia michaels piece from the other week i found the choreography was lacking but the vibe and story behind the dance and the emotion from lacey and neil made it beautiful krissy sorry to you if i came off attacking i was a bit offended from a previous post from you but i think we actually have quite alot in common from reading your profile almost shocking so and i would like to talk to you some more if you are interested respectfully yours joonday hotmail com Glossary of partner dance terms Aerial (dance move) Emotions (album) Belly dance The Ashlee Simpson Show Dance I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Jon Secada Kylie Minogue Sharon Tate Friends Lindy Hop Contredanse Miss Saigon Marching band Boston Public Social rule The Amber Spyglass Little Britain Swingout Theory of conduct Garth Brooks Taxi Driver TLC Urinary incontinence Crazy in Love The Emancipation of Mimi Orlando Magic Irish dance Yoko Ono Asperger syndrome God Emperor of Dune Modern dance Janet Jackson Donovan Paula Abdul Madonna (entertainer) Whitney Houston ABBA Alex Ferguson One Tree Hill (TV series) Rod Stewart 1957 World Series Glossary of ballet terms Jennifer Lopez History of dance Princess Tutu Tupac Shakur Kasparov versus The World Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Tango (dance) Carpenters Galaxy Angel Sabra and Shatila massacre Saved by the Bell Vanilla Ninja Daria Scientology beliefs and practices Wonderland (McFly album) Ocean's Twelve Kim Possible: So the Drama Megan Griffin Child sexuality Compiler optimization Pok__mon Live!
