can i still do ballet if i am doing track and field as well from the age of five i did ballet by the age of ten or eleven i decided to quit and join track and field today i still do track but am wondering if it would be possible to join ballet again since my leg muscles are more developed for track and field of course you can always do ballet again however there are a few things you should know a dancer's muscles are very different from the muscles you use for track your muscles will be a little bulkier and developed in different areas than people in ballet track is not always good for ballet the impact of running is can be harsh on dancer's legs because it can multiply the weight by however you already have developed resistance to the impact since you have been running so you are okay there bonus you probaly already have developed ankle and core muscles which helps alot in dance when at home practicing for dance really concentrate on turnout and using the correct muscles never give up anything you love and i'm sure you can keep up with both since you are already expirienced have fun work hard and enjoy what you are doing and you should suceed in both good luck Weight training Dance Modern dance Aerial (dance move) Glossary of ballet terms Irish dance Lindy Hop Proprioception Ashlee Simpson Equine conformation Figure skating Ballet En pointe Terminal ballistics Pointe shoes Rod Stewart Belly dance Diving Fleetwood Mac Exercise Dragon Booster Glossary of partner dance terms Royal Danish Ballet Connection (dance) Highland games Bicycle Scottish highland dance Kathak Afternoon of a Faun (ballet) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling throws C__line Dion Robert Helpmann Jazz dance Tap dance Gwen Verdon Fecal incontinence Princess Tutu Rudolf Nureyev Love.
