is it too late for me to take ballet classes again i took ballet classes for five years from when i wa to when i was years old i stopped after my dance teacher got sick and couldn't teach anymore now i take latin ballroom classes so i havent been totally out of dance but im scared im not going to be very good at ballet anymore nervous about trying it again but at the same time i want to do it since ballet is a good foundation for technique well you didn't mention wanting to go pro so why would it be too late my studio offers a bunch of adult classes and they're full of people who are there for reasons ranging from cross training like you to wanting to get out and be active to just wanting to meet new people trust me if a fifty year old guy can take a class when he's never danced before in his life you can too anyway it might take some time to get your technique back but that's to be expected so what it'll come back and anyone who gives you grief for not being perfect right away is not someone i would take seriously Glossary of partner dance terms Martial art Modern dance Ballroom dance Ballet Jacob's Pillow The Ashlee Simpson Show Lindy Hop Dance Kodocha Dog agility Past teachings of Prem Rawat Shaggy dog story Negima Time Out of Mind Scottish highland dance Timpani Alexander Technique West Coast Swing Columbia University Wang Chongyang Tai Chi Chuan Blood on the Tracks Avenue Q Stewie Griffin Education in the People's Republic of China Bart chalkboard gags Glossary of ballet terms The Fairly OddParents Circle (dance move) Jon Secada Contredanse Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Computer and video game genres Education in Germany Methos Le Malade imaginaire Professor YuYu Hakusho W.I.T.C.H.
