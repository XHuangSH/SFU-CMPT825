please answer this i really want to be able to do my middle splits in a month and i was wondering if you guys knew any good stretches that i could do also i got my other type of splits in weeks and i only stretched for about minutes a day so how long do you think it will take me to do my middle splits ps i'm not fat i'm ' and lbs heya hopefully this will be of help to you please message me and let me know how you go steps stretch first do some lunges to get warmed up make sure you warm up properly though or else you could pull or tear a muscle and that hurts once warmed up sit with legs together and reach both hands until you have your feet in your hands keep your back as straight as possible breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds while seated bend one leg with foot back and away from body knee should be about degrees away from other straight leg reach for foot of straight leg breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat with other leg lay on back with one leg straight pull other knee to chest with both hands breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds then pull same knee gently to the side until upper arm is flat on ground if it hurts stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds with hand of same side grab outside of foot palm down and pull towards body if it hurts stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds with both hands grab same part of foot and gently pull towards center and hold if it hurts stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side sit back up and place foot of one leg flat to the outside of the knee of the other and rotate upper body so that you can put the elbow of the straight legged side to the out side of bent knee look behind you as you do this this one s a yoga move i just don t remember what it s called breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side now put soles of feet together and as close to the groin area as possible grab the outsides of your feet together while knitting fingers use your elbows to push down knees keep back straight go as far down as you can with out pain in the knee if you feel any knee pain or pressure ease up or stop breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds from this position extend one leg so that knee of extended leg is against sole of foot reach for sole of extended leg s foot keep back strait and don t bounce breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side now spread legs as far as comfortable reach towards center with back straight then reach for either sole with back as straight as manageable breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds for each side and center spread legs a little further if you can and repeat center lie on stomach and bring bent leg under body so that knee is close to sternum and back is straight and parallel to ground breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds from this position put palms on ground and push chest upward so that leg behind and upper body bend toward each other stretching abdomen a little breathe normally and deeply hold for seconds repeat other side after this you can attempt the splits a little but don t try to go all the way down it will take several months or more if you re super old like me but do not rush it or you may hurt yourself always make sure there is no undue pressure on your knees and or back and if there is stop immediately don t risk injury tips the key to this is repetition if you do it a lot one day and then don't do it again for days it won't work as well if you want the best results you must do this everyday i know it's hard but at the begginning try and stay on your heels when going down and have your knees facing the ceiling that way you'll be working on your turnout once you do get on the floor though roll forward so that your tummy is flat on the ground along with your groin and your knees are facing forward parallell with the ground this will give you a really good stretch if you cant get on the ground yet why not sit on your bum with your legs out in front of you and then pull your legs out to second as far as they will go then put your hand in front of you and reach for ward and pull yourself through this maybe hard i usually get my brother to pull my hand for me this is called rolling through the splits and gives a really great stretch really amazing but please make sure you be carefull coz it is easier to injure yourself in this and i dot want you do get hurt a very detailed and helpful resource for getting the splits down http drillobsession com fle things you ll need try using some padding underneath you because it makes the splits alot more comfortable but padding isn't required when i strtch i ussually do it on my bed because it doesn't hurt that much ad then once i'm done with the bed i do it on my wooden floor and i put two tea towels under my heel so that it is easier to slide i wish you luck i apologize if the descriptions are hard to follow if you do need any more help i am more than happy to be of assistance so message me or something mwah mwah xoxo twinkle toes p s i think the middle splits are harder than the others so i'm advising you do stretch fr more that five mins and stretch twice a day just as you wae up and before you go to sleep make sure you warm up first Powerbomb Clean and jerk Glossary of American football Casualty
