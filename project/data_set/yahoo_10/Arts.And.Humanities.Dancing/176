should i dance or not should i dance i am nothign special but i got a couple of moves should i hit the dance floor with the girls or jsut sit back and not dance well lets see it looks like you dont feel very comfortable with yourself dancing normal and very common most people dont feel completely competent on that trust me i dance since years old im running a dance studio now ive seen and experienced much many people have this problem they come to my classes not because they can but because they 'cant dance' as they say 'i dance as a tree can dance' is a classical complaint dancing is not like reading while reading nobody can see your mind but while dancing your body is exposed to everybody's attention this is the fight to get over your fear so remember you are not alone most people have these feelings just some of them have learned how to overcome it and they tried then they started learning more about themselves dancing some of them look for a professional help in dance studios so dont give up try it if it doesnt come out ask for help but if you really want to dance dont give up on this because dancing is a release of so many things in life good luck Atomic Kitten Jennifer Lopez Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Milton H.
