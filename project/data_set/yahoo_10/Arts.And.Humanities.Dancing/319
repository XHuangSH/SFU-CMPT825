which is the best web address to find free belly dancing instruction please i'll love to learn belly dancing i would like to have opinions as to which ones are the best web pages where they show how to belly dance with photos pehaps videos etc any ideas will be much appreciated thanks so much the only real way to learn is to take lessons you cannot learn well from a video book or website here are some resources for you to look into keep in mind that anything other than an actual instructor is meant to be supplemental to your live instruction these materials are meant to enhance and reinforce what's learned if nothing else take beginners lessons so you at least know how to do the basics and then you will be able to learn from supplemental sources like videos books and websites much better websites for finding teachers classes http www shira net probably the most extensive directory http www middleeasterndance net my site which has a decent sized directory as well http www bhuz com another large directory as well as a great forum which can answer pretty much every question you will ever have about bellydance since it's comprised of bellydancers from all over the world if you can't find lessons looking on these three sites there may not be any in your area websites for learning moves on line http www middleeasterndance net my own site look under the movements section there

htm another old well respected website full of information you should check out she offers a few instructions for several basic moves http www kawakib com page html more of a technique lesson but might be helpful after learning some basics http www raqs co nz moves html has some descriptions of select movements books belly dancing basics by laura a cooper isbn x newer book not great but not bad either the art of belly dancing by dahlena with dona z meilach this book is out of print but shows up on amazon and e bay from time to time it's ok but it's written for a different time the history part is especially questionable but the moves are pretty straight forward grandmother's secrets by rosina fawzia al rawi isbn an interesting read has several descriptions of dance moves as well a lot of books have been coming on the market recently and most of them excluding out of print books are available at barnes and nobel or borders books as well as other chains and smaller stores on line instructional videos http www trybellydancing com like a mini instructional video available online it's not bad quality http www expertvillage com interviews egyptian belly dancing htm several mini instructional segments on various moves as well as zills costuming and musicality http bellyrolls com howtopage html more mini on line instructionals the video quality is a little poorer and not

for fitness series by neena and veena bidasher this series is very cheap and available from major retailers like target walmart borders and barnes and nobel but the quality of instruction is low this is more of a workout for beginner dancers who already have had some training the videos are a good quality as far as picture and sound but these are not good for an absolute beginner if you have any
