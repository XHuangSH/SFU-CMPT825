are there any updo hair style websites for dancers i am actually a figure skater but i thought maybe dancers would need similar resources as we do in skating most of us long haired ladies must have their hair in an updo or else it gets in our way and actually throws our center off but we're not supposed to use bobby pins and other hair accessories that can potentially fall off in our rigorous movement it's an ice hazard for us so basically i'm looking for a site that helps with athletic dance hair styles practical but pretty and stays put sometimes a pony tail or using a scrunchie just gets boring lookin' thank you all for any links or suggestions i used to put by hair into a bun with hairthings and then throw a hairnet over so pieces wouldnt fall out u could also braid ur hair how about bun pigtails sorry thats all i have Figure skating Haircut Ice dancing Roller skating Skateboarding trick Winter Olympic Games Contredanse Irish dance Shoe Glossary of partner dance terms My Little Pony Dance West Coast Swing Professional wrestling match types Artistic roller skating Ponytail Swingout Compulsory figures The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Tango (dance) Teen Girl Squad Punk fashion Professional wrestling holds Ballet Tara Lipinski Speed skating Aerial (dance move) Dreadlocks Figure skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics Professional wrestling throws Carol Heiss Ice hockey Skateboard Lu Chen Belly dance Highland games Ruy Lopez Janet Lynn Bicycle helmet New York Mets Kimono The Mikado Barbie Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards Inline speed skating Kodocha Skateboarding Hip hop culture Sonja Henie Ice skating Lindy Hop Katarina Witt Dog 2005 World Series Suplex Owen figure-skating family Salsa (dance) Comanche Liquid dancing Serialism Tonya Harding Golf Parkour John Curry Salchow jump Pterosaur English Country Dance Olympic Flame Kristi Yamaguchi Baldness The Amber Spyglass Equine conformation Kilt Cross-country skiing Aikido Breakdancing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 Roller hockey Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Hypnosis Modern dance Bicycle Chess Sari Cornrows Martial art Chav John Cage Squidward Tentacles Show hunter Sonata (music) Violin Jim Bunning Sling (weapon) Anorexia nervosa The Smurfs Britney Spears Caller (dance)
