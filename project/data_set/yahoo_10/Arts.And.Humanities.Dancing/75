what can i expect if i start taking jazz dance lessons i've strictly been a latin and ballroom dancer but i've always wanted to take jazz what should i expect how should i dress are there shoes for jazz i remember when i took african dance there was no one in there that wasn't a dancer everyone was a dancer of some trade in jazz are there people starting off for the very first time i'm ok you're not too late for your age to take jazz lessons but start sooner why coz you will do a lot of stretching and warm ups you will experience the following french terms for jazz ballet as well routines such as jete grand jete plie etc etc other terms like single and double step and so many others expect lots of bumps and bruises on your feet arms and legs for fast routines normal for you to fall or hit the wall splitting is so normal i hope you do already warm ups in jazz take mins to an hour depending on the choreographer find a nice pair of tights or leotards or leg warmers as well for your outfit a jogging pants will do but make sure it's stretchable and durable ballet shoes will do but in my experience i'm more comfortable in barefoot while rehearsing to add more grip on the floor in jazz or even ballet dance steps are easily created mentioning only the terms so be quick to remember them for your routines mind you dancing jazz is addictive whenever you hear some music you would feel like flying with those routines you had learned you will feel very light and alert once you learn to isolate those parts of your body and will be very graceful with your moves one thing i've noticed with jazz and ballet dancers as well they walk with their feet outwards this is due to rigorous stretching on the floor and on the bar have fun these are all my first hand experiences and until now i feel sexy because of jazz Aerial (dance move) Lindy Hop Glossary of ballet terms Irish dance Glossary of partner dance terms Contredanse Swingout Tap dance Jazz Figure skating Tango (dance) West Coast Swing Dance Diving Equine conformation Modern dance Marching band Professional wrestling holds Volleyball Ballroom dance Circle (dance move) Scottish country dance English Country Dance Horse gait Breakdancing Can-can Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Badminton Ceroc Music genre Swing (dance) Social rule Side pass (dance move) Milton H.
