a question about dance studios ok ive been danceing for years and i am still horrible i mean i guess i am good at the actual danceing part i just have limited flexibility and balance so i cant really do fancy stuff like multiple pirouettes fouettes and stuff like that well the dance studio i am at now doesnt really teach the recreational kids how to do pirouettes or fouettes or the correct way to do leaps we go across the floor but thats only for minutes so it doesnt really help and it sucks because i always wanted to be a dancer but i feel like the studio i am at is holding me back somehow so i kinda want to switch plus some girls dont like me there because of my 'vibrant personality' lol n e way so i was looking for other studios online but they all seem so different ya know i mean i like the studio i am at now because the teachers are nice adn i know them and its pretty free and not strict which is what i like and they have all the classes i like so when i look at other studios i k they just look wierd so my question is should i keep my same dance studio even though there are snotty competition brats there and they dont teach us how to dance or switch studios no we dont take classes with the competition girls i just dont want to feel like a loser danceing with them at the recitals and stuff and i know they talk about us becaus ewere not as good as them and i already am in the highest rec level at my studio there are only but pretty much u can move urself up if u want so we have girls that should be in the rd level in the th i think you should totally go out of your comfort zone and switch studios i know exactly how you feel because i was in the exact situation years ago i had recently switched to a new studio and i felt that i was being held back because i wasn't quite good enough to be in competition but i wasn't getting the help i needed in order to improve and move up to competition i decided to switch to a dance studio that had regular classes semi competition lines and competition lines for my first years there i was accpeted into the semi performing lines which i was fine about because i was learning a lot of new things but i still wasn't very happy because i like you thought the competition girls were snotty and always talked about how they were better than us this last year i was finally accepted into the nd best of competition lines and i realized i was very wrong to judge those girls they didn't talk about the lower classes at all and they turned out to be the nicest girls i know when i look back and think of how at first i wasn't sure if i wanted to switch studios i realize now that i am soooo thankful i did it changed my life i have so many gret new friends and i feel like i truly have become a great dancer if you're apprehensive about starting at a new studio try and take classes at both your current studio and the one you are considering that way you won't have a problem going back to the old one if the new one doesn't work out i can't encourage you enough to check out other studios in your area it could completely change your life for the better and hey whats the worst that could happen worst case you continue your classes at your current studio it's probably not as bad as you make it out to be be proud of the fact that you have personality that's what makes lots of dancers who they are when they perform on stage and finally don't worry about what you think the competition girls are saying about you because it's probably not true anyway i see it like this the girls in competition have the natural talent to dance and yes we work very hard to improve but it comes naturally to us the girls in the regualar classes and semi competition lines try hard too it's just that they have decided not to make dance the only commitment in their lives and maybe it doesn't come as naturally to them so what my advice to you is to try out a few other studios one that focuses energy on teaching the recreation classes how to improve if they so wish as well best of luck to you and feel free to contact me if you like christina Theory of conduct Glossary of ballet terms Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Martial art 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Atomic Kitten Pitaten Irish dance Cliff Richard Friends Jennifer Lopez Milton H.
