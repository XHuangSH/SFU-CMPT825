pointe question i realize that this question may sound stupid but i'm gonna ask anyways as i'm really curious i'm just a beginning dancer does dancing on pointe hurt at all how do dancers deal with the pain if any pointe dancers deal with pain in different ways personally i don't think dancing on pointe hurts too much but i have very good shoes also when i first started i got a brand that was very popular but i hated them then i switched to gaynor minden and haven't went off them since the only thing that hurts for me is when i cut my toenails too short or when my ankles get sore from all of the up and down movement some dancers take a small amount of painkiller but i don't think that's very wise because they need to know when they're hurting so they can tell if something is wrong i personally just live with the pain if there is any we learn to tough it out Pointe shoes Diving Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) High-heeled shoe Equine conformation Contredanse The Ashlee Simpson Show Belly dance Irish dance Jennifer Lopez Shaggy dog story Kodocha Spanking Cindy Sheehan Rush Limbaugh Nine Inch Nails Utilitarianism Stoicism Tai Chi Chuan Glossary of ballet terms Tina Turner Value system Dance Lindy Hop Jon Secada Tap dance Indian English Goodness and value theory Smallville (Season 4) Alcoholics Anonymous Hip hop culture R.E.M.
