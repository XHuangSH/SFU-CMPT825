modern dance i am interested in taking a modern dance class at my college and was wondering what people think i have years of jazz and tap but have never taken modern thoughts modern is cool because it incorporates a lot of technique from other forms of dance especially jazz and in turn ballet i took a lot of modern in college and i really enjoyed it its very unique and its open to a lot of interpretation i think you'll have fun and youre previous jazz and tap experience will be a valuable asset Lindy Hop Jazz dance Dance Irish dance Jazz Glossary of partner dance terms Free jazz Tap dance Music genre Martial art Modern dance Bass guitar Australian jazz Dance of the United States Music Genesis (band) Modernism En pointe Ballet Scottish highland dance Aerial (dance move) Blood on the Tracks Joni Mitchell Scottish country dance Roaring Twenties Circle (dance move) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Mixed martial arts Serialism Igor Stravinsky Theatre Authentic performance Jazz fusion Sylvia (ballet) Louis Armstrong Sherlock Holmes Trey Anastasio Jacob's Pillow Gwen Verdon Melanie Thornton Black Sabbath Postmodern music Hip hop culture Arts in Birmingham Jerome Robbins Back to the Future Swing (dance) Surrealism Timpani Tom Waits Bitches Brew Music of Ireland Ballroom dance Cal Tjader Glossary of ballet terms Diablo II: Lord of Destruction This Is Spinal Tap Tony Bennett Electronic music Music of the United States Rastafari movement Grammy Award Pat Metheny Eton College Corporation Ragtime The Ashlee Simpson Show The Wiggles The Apprentice 2 Music of France Intelligent dance music Harlem Renaissance Chick Corea Saved by the Bell Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Heavy metal music About a Boy Mickey Mouse Drum and bass Frankie Laine Tapping Charleston (dance move) Marching band Glastonbury Festival Surplus product Music Hall Ira Gershwin Mode choice University of Massachusetts Amherst Carnival Sun Ra Guitar Beavis and Butt-head The Jazz Singer Smith College House music 20th century concert dance Music history of the United States (1940s and 50s) Highland games Jazz dance moves
