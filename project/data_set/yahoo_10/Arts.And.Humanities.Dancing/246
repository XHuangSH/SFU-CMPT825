ballroom dance shoes i need help okay i have been using a pair of regular high heels for dancing the past months because i was saving up for a good pair of ballroom dance shoes now that i have the money and my feet hurt i don't know where to buy a good pair of shoes that will last me for a while can anyone help me i also have very odd feet they are very very wide and i like to buy shoes that make them look thinner i wear a size are you looking for latin sandals or standard court or social shoes closed toe but made like a sandal everywhere else it is the best if you can find a local dance shoe store fitting your first pair is important it's not trivial at all if that is not possible you can order from the internet but make sure they have good return policies in case you need to return them you need something that will be comfortable not only look good in general anything with pointed toe looks slimming and anything with straps that wrap around the ankle and close at the ankle in sandals strappy sandals look more slimming than those with one piece of fabric forming the whole toebox i find strappy sandals more comfortable too because the straps will move a little bit to conform to your foot look into the brand called international they are the only brand i know that makes shoes with different width without special order i have unusually narrow feet i know it's a headache or foot ache to have unusual feet this is the brand i wear they last me about a year with moderate use times a week and taking good care of them it is a professional quality shoe you can find them on http www dancesport uk com also look into the brand stephanie especially look at their adjustable buckle design i think they have it on the front page http www featherdanceshoes com if you're a student they have student discount their shoes are one step below professional quality in my opinion but they are cheaper too they will last for a while but probably a little shorter lifetime than international or supadance they are softer than int or supa which is a big plus at the beginning but this is why they wear out sooner whatever you buy do not i repeat do not buy capezio their shoes don't have proper shank in ladies ballroom shoes in general you want a shoe with metal shank it will protect your feet from injuries and will make your shoe last longer i can post more details but i don't know what would be helpful i can explain more about fittings or more about styles brands but if you can specify if you have narrow wide ankle deep or shallow ankle if you have big arch small arch no arch Shoe High-heeled shoe Glossary of partner dance terms Equine conformation Snowboard Kimono Drill bit Undergarment Mattress Sock Aerial (dance move) Ballroom dance Strap-on dildo Japanese tea ceremony Irish dance Marching band Snowboarding Professional wrestling holds Foot Glossary of ballet terms Figure skating Tire Pointe shoes Volleyball Contredanse Stairway Diving Suit (clothes) Customs and etiquette of Japan Violin Ski Diving suit Punt (boat) Tango (dance) Platform shoe Motorcycle Sears Holdings Corporation Badminton Footwear Flip-flop Kurt Angle Upholstery Leggings Wrench Massage Scuba set Flat feet Skateboarding trick Anchor Menstrual cup Shoe size HyperText Transfer Protocol Swingout Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tap dance Glossary of climbing terms Eyepiece Professional wrestling slang O scale Clothing Lindy Hop Trish Stratus Transmission Control Protocol Table saw Professional wrestling match types Dog agility Floppy disk World Wide Web Seismic retrofit Climbing equipment Electronic commerce Saxophone Tesco Boxing Solar cell Web crawler Bassoon MTV2 Casualty lifting Extreme Programming Bicycle frame Compiler optimization X86 assembly language Casting Uniform Resource Locator West Coast Swing CPU cache Inflation Software engineering Billiards Snowshoe Tai Chi Chuan Evolution of the Horse Shoelaces Vince McMahon De Lorean DMC-12
