does anyone know of a dance class for children in kidderminster in worcestershire thanks my daughter would really like to go to a dance class so if you know of any could you let me know thanks go to this website and click on contact and ask for a list http www istd org main html they are a very reputable organisation and carry a list of recognised schools also look in your local yellow pages or on yell com but do be careful because dance teachers do not need to be qualified and although you might feel it is only for fun it is so important that the training is good because you are dealing with a growing body which does need knowledge in order not to force or damage the body so check out that the teacher holds some sort of recognised certificate if there is a dancewear shop in your area it doesn't need to be in your own town because people do travel for that kind of thing then they will know who is good in your area because they will supply all the dancewear for exams etc usually the dance shops are a mine of information and there is bound to be one in worcester Irish dance Teacher HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Driver's license Cross site scripting Martial art Worcester World Wide Web Glossary of partner dance terms Ceroc Motion picture rating system Phishing HTML HTML element Education in Japan Requirements analysis Education in Germany Kidderminster Internet fraud Domain Name System Certification Pitaten Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus SAML WebObjects Lynbrook High School Trademark Lawyer Independent school (UK) Franklin W.
