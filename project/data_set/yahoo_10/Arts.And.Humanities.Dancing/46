emo goth i don't understand people ok before i start my question so many people argue over the true meaning of what emo and goth means so before i get to my question i feel i have to explain cause i know that theres bound to be one or two idiots that come in here and say something stupid like emo people hate life and they all wanna die or goth people all paint their face and wear only black i hate stereotypes so before i get into my question i am goign to explain what emo and goth really mean emo emo much like almost all terms in the world does not mean just one thing the first use of the word does not neccessarily mean every use of the word just as the words desert mean light leave and on and on all have more then one meanings so does emo and all the meanings of emo are an abbriviation of a bigger word for example emotive emotional emulator but for the most part my reference today is about emo emotional and dont be the retard that says emo is not short for emotional goth goth are not people who all wear black clothes we dont all paint our faces we don't worship satan and aren't evil despite what some ignorant people might say we dont all listen to techno or deathmetal one person even said real goths are not depressing and suicidal thats not true either just cause someone is depressed or has emotional problems does not mean they are not gothic what goth realy is someone who likes the darker side of things sees the beauty in what other call gloomy or depressing someone who sees the artistic aspect of things not so pleasent to some so to my question why doe people stereotype why does everyone thing emo people cut themself why do people all say goths worship the devil why do pople say that emo's or goths dress or act a certain way why why why pinkkkk emo people are very emotional and very sensitive and practically bipolar but i don't think they want to die i thank thats when you cross the line to goth did u not read anything i said now your doing exactly what i hate 'stereotyping goths do not want to die and i dont know many emo's that have f cking bipolar wtf cryptotich emo and goth have deep roots in the 's scene for one goth did not originate in the last years goth came from the th century of a race of people that lived in the same reagon as the hun's a race of people who would not conform to the ways of the country so they were outcasted lilykdesign you have had the most intelligent answer thus far but i dont agree with some of what you said however you have not helped the rest of us here by stating your rant in fact you've made it worse by furthering the styretypes that emos are brainless how the f ck am i furthering the stereotype that emo's are brainless most emos misinterpret that to mean it gives them the god given right to be over dramatic little turds this has given birth to stereotypes most no i dont think so but yes i agree that a lot do very good point of course there is a huge difference between emo and goth real goths would more than likely beat the snot out of you if you dared to suggest they might be emo this is not true not all goths go around beating people up a lot of goths keep to themselves just like emo do thats not an aspect of goth or emo also like i said before this post has nothing to do with music or its use in it cerantine freaking emogoth go rant on a vampire website another stereotypical dumbazz dude if you don't have any intelligent feedback shut the f ck up goths are not vampire's goth's don't think they are vampires do not confuse a goth with a poser cerantine freaking emogoth go rant on a vampire website i'm not the one who frickin posted my rant on a dance forum if you don't want to be stereotyped get over yourself and go buy some yellow clothes you messed up poser lol just stfu i didnt intend to post this in a dance forum i did not select dance forum obviously it was a glitch ive already reported this to the site tech support i dont wear only black stupid f ck so just f ck off and stop posting lilykdesign bauhaus first concerts said they reminded him of the victorian gothic movement hence where the term goth was coined your an idiot bauhaus did not coin the term goth the term goth has been around since the early th century bugaboo why is this in the dance catagory you need a life i've already explained why this is in the dance section i'm sorry you cant read i need a life because id like to discuss the unnecessary point of stereotypes lol if you say so chris p as far as i can tell emo kids are popkids well i can see like most all these other brainless zombies you didn't see my post at all obviously you read it but you didn't see it cause you didn't get it at all for u didn't answer my question and ndly you did exactly what this post was about stereotyping no i don't like pop and i'm not a kid so nope sorry try again as a goth and i've been a goth since the 's i can tell you that you had it closest when you said it's about seeing the beauty in the darker side of things the old goth cliche says it best there can be no light without dark goths chose to embrace that dark and see the beauty within it if you're interested in the late s it was actually bauhaus that ruled the goth music movement the cure came along a little later so i can't speak for emo kids as i am not one nor do i worship the devil i don't paint my face white and never have i do where all black but do not dress in victorian garb as for your question about stereotypes labeling ourselves as goth emo jock etc is the ugly cousin of stereotyping once we put that label on ourselves or another we have started the ugly ball rolling remember the grunge phase it has been going on for years and years and unfortunately people will always stereotype each other especially when they do not understand or see the other's view i've known nerds who were just as cruel and taunting as jocks and jocks who have the hearts of saints stereotyping has been around for years and until people let down their protective goth walls or jock walls or whatever little pigeon hole they have found a safe place in and realise that we are all on this earth together and not so different after all it will continue great now i sound like a hippie joke intended Recurring South Park characters Pop punk Death rock Grunge music Kyle Broflovski 21st
