how can i keep pointe shoes from slipping off of the heels my daughters toe shoes were professionally fitted and seemed to work just fine the first few times she wore them they are her th pair now that they are broken in however they keep slipping off her heels can i fix this problem by repositioning the elastics or laces or should we return to the store which is a hour drive for us i'm not sure how you sew your ribbons or elastics on but my teacher makes us take a small piece of elastic and fold it in half into a loop and sew it on the top part of the back of the shoe so you have a little loop of elastic sticking out the top of the heel and when she laces her ribbons up have her stick them through the loop it will help keep the shoe attached in the back better and hold them up Stocking Shoe Knitting Shoelaces Textile manufacturing terminology Glossary of climbing terms Equine conformation Undergarment Sock Climbing equipment Textile manufacturing Irish dance Earring Boot Sewing machine Gothic Lolita Screw Skinhead Black tie Professional wrestling holds Billiards Elastic Figure skating Snowboard Japanese tea ceremony Cowboy boot Mattress Knife Menstrual cup Footwear Violin Compiler optimization Marching band Tightlacing Professional wrestling match types Leggings Kurt Angle Professional wrestling slang Cowboy Comanche Strap-on dildo Kilt Necktie Sailing Fast bowling Clothing Shirt Shodo Lace-making Sewing Pole vault Loafers Tatting Cello Eddie Guerrero Boxing Softball Sailor fuku Dinghy Velcro Callus Sling (weapon) Pointe shoes Poker jargon Manifold Foot Corset Disentanglement puzzle Interchange (road) Bookbinding Glossary of ballet terms Flax Laptop Dental brace Lindy Basic Trapping Fencing Car handling Glasses Space elevator Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Potential energy Skateboarding trick Badminton Ski binding Battle of Spotsylvania Court House Hiking (sailing) Roller skating Escalator Collision detection Rubber IBM PC compatible Professional wrestling attacks Fixed-wing aircraft Characters in the Smurfs Snowshoe
