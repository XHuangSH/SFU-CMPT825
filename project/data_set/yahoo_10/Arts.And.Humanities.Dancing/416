how do i dance in a club as a guy i've been to a couple of clubs but most of the time it's just the girls dancing and the occasional creeper who pops in and starts grinding only to be left alone after the song is over besides just going with the flow what are some basic moves i could string together on the dance floor i've heard all it takes is confidence but i'd be a lot more confident if i had a better idea of what i was doing don't let your elbows out keep them close to your side it helps keep you looking less retarded or take a hip hop or break dancing class since that style of dance is more acceptable for males really the most important thing is to dance on beat with the music and don't overdo your movements but if you don't care how you look just dance how you feel you want to and have fun Lindy Hop Swingout Aerial (dance move) Hip hop culture Glossary of partner dance terms West Coast Swing Hip hop music The Emancipation of Mimi Alternative hip hop Breakdancing Disc jockey Reggaeton Jennifer Lopez Charleston (dance move) Balboa (dance) Salsa (dance) Side pass (dance move) Freestyle music Lindy Basic Rhythm and blues Bemani Hollaback Girl Music of Puerto Rico We Belong Together House music The Chemical Brothers Kylie Minogue En Vogue 2Step Tango (dance) Lead and follow (dance) Drum and bass Contredanse Remix Scottish country dance Sampling (music) MTV2 Missy Elliott Glossary of ballet terms Hall & Oates Madonna (entertainer) Pop music Trip hop Whitney Houston Music history of the United States Circle (dance move) Usher (entertainer) Nu metal Prince (artist) Iggy Pop Latin American music The Isley Brothers Beastie Boys Music of the United Kingdom (1990s-present) American popular music Time Out of Mind The Beatles discography Herbie Hancock Equine conformation Rapping Jazz Modern Western square dance Canadian hip hop Music of Nigeria Social rule Jon Secada History of subcultures in the 20th century Toni Braxton Sugar push Tina Turner Hip hop rivalries Britney Spears Salsa music Rock (music) Music of Scotland Acid jazz Destiny's Child MTV Europe Music Awards Spice Girls Disco Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind James Brown (musician) Swing (dance) The Supremes Buddy Guy The Ashlee Simpson Show Professional wrestling aerial techniques Gwen Stefani Galaxy Angel Duran Duran African American music Fast bowling Beatmatching Professional wrestling holds Music of Hawaii Milton H.
