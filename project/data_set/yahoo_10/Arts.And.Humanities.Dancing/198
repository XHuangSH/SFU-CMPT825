i really want to learn contemporary dance but i think i'm too old to start now does anyone know a place around san jose that i can learn well without being embarassed i'm fifteen i just think that most kids start dancing really early so even at this age i'll be old check the san jose website for dancing schools many dance studios have different levels of classes you might be in a class with some younger or even some older students heck you might get in a class with older students over considered adults you are not too old don't worry about being embarrassed everyone has to start at the beginning and then progress forward the teacher will correct you on execution and once you feel good about dancing you'll really love it don't worry about making a mistake everyone makes mistakes just watch even the teacher might make a mistake it's human nature the thing to do is just try what will happen if you don't try dancing you'll probably regret it so go ahead and take a class it will be fun and something different to do good luck The Adventures of Pete & Pete Murdock-Portal Elementary School Social rule Education Ballroom dance Pitaten Lynbrook High School Current teachings of Prem Rawat Azumanga Daioh Lindy Hop Hall & Oates Columbine High School massacre Graduate school Humphrey Bogart Galaxy Angel One Tree Hill (TV series) A Course In Miracles AFI 100 Years series Teachers (film) Irish dance The Ashlee Simpson Show Phoebe Halliwell The Magic School Bus Miami-Dade County Public Schools Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Napoleon Dynamite Alexander Technique Objectivist philosophy Anne Murray Non-native pronunciations of English Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Jacob's Pillow The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Donna Summer Singlish Shaggy dog story Can't Hardly Wait Socrates Scottish country dance Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Team Fortress Classic Sheryl Crow Scottish highland dance Emotions (album) West Coast Swing Cardcaptor Sakura True Crime: Streets of LA The Fairly OddParents Age of consent Aikido Homeschooling Bart chalkboard gags Ty Cobb Cliff Richard University of Houston Transactional analysis Daryl Hall Modern dance The Amazing Race Yoko Ono Negima The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Debugging Asperger syndrome Modern Western square dance The Beach Boys The Chemical Brothers Care Bears Python programming language Kodocha I Want to Hold Your Hand Piccolo Junior Saga Education in Hong Kong Aerial (dance move) Generation X About a Boy Lauren Bacall Emo Teacher's Pet (Disney) Scooby-Doo Sergei Prokofiev Jean-Luc Picard Treehouse of Horror V San Fernando City, Pampanga Fame Academy Glossary of partner dance terms Lesson Kindergarten Disgaea: Hour of Darkness Our Gang Diving The Shining (film) No Child Left Behind Act Stuttering Great Teacher Onizuka The Giver Milton H.
