my belly dance teacher has asked me to join her to create a troupe and help her teach classes any advice it's my first official belly dance class i've been studying belly dance at home with educational dvds my teacher is very excited to see me entering her class and go beyond the rest of the group of students and she's asked me to help her create a dance troupe with her i accepted and she wants my help with the oncoming fall classes to help teach the students about posture and new belly dance moves got any tips for me on my new job helping teach newer dancers is great my daughter started taking classes about years after i did since her class was immediately before mine i was there for both classes my instructor wouldn't let me just watch of course i usually stayed to the side of the group and helped by taking aside those who were having problems with a particular movement helping others actually helped me to learn the movements much better myself i had to really understand the movement so i could explain it clearly to others you could go through various movements and pretend that you are trying to explain it to another dancer so you will be more comfortable when you are actually breaking it down and explaining it to someone else you may want to ask your teacher what it is that she expects from a troupe and the roles and tasks that she wants you to handle within the troupe good luck Belly dance Modern Western square dance West Coast Swing Aerial (dance move) Modern dance Graduate school Dance Lindy Hop Tai Chi Chuan Caller (dance) Kodocha Lead and follow (dance) Alexander Technique Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dog training Current teachings of Prem Rawat Contredanse Martial art Miss Saigon Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Japan Boston Public Education in Germany Aikido A Course In Miracles Dancing at Lughnasa Great Teacher Onizuka Drama Education Diving The Legend of Zelda series characters Le Malade imaginaire Fiddler on the Roof Hogwarts subjects GED Glossary of partner dance terms Teacher Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Parachuting Japanese tea ceremony Animal communication Teach the Controversy Secondary education in Japan Extreme Programming The Fourth Way Guru Gopinath Music of Ireland Avenue Q Irish dance Education in Romania Past teachings of Prem Rawat Experiential education Glossary of ballet terms Ceroc God Emperor of Dune K____ek Homeschooling Phoebe Halliwell Clergy The Catcher in the Rye Intelligent design movement Education in the United States Secondary education in France Line dance The Shining (film) Ruby Keeler Random Harvest Community college Software engineering Galaxy Angel Beavis and Butt-head Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Ballroom dance Bj__rk Salsa (dance) Richard Feynman Scottish highland dance Social rule The Star Wars Holiday Special Philosophy of education Education in Portugal Social psychology Education in Hong Kong Pitaten Jiddu Krishnamurti Creationism Jacob Pavlovitch Adler Charmed Virginia Lee Burton Sivagamiyin sabadham Friends Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Suplex Expert system Violin Tuition Columbia University Oh My Goddess!
