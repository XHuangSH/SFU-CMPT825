do you think pregnant belly dancers look just as good dancing as regular belly dancers i'm pregnant and many of my bellydancing friends are happy that i'm continuing to dance because bellydancing is considered the fertility dance but i feel aqkward because i don't look like them and none of them are pregnant to talk about it to my husband says i look great but he's the one who sees me more than anyone else i want to know what someone who is seeing me for the first time would think of me dancing and being pregnant belly dancing actually originated in canaan as a series of exercises meant to strengthen muscles in order to ease the birthing process as you said it's the fertility dance i don't think it's distasteful or awkward at all it's only natural that a pregnant woman should dance the feritility dance of course if you feel awkward and it shows that will make the spectators feel awkward you might want to release your inhibitions before you dance again and don't listen to the guy above me locking away pregnant women during gestation and making them keep to their beds is an outdated victorian ideal pregnant women need plenty of exercising and a centuries old aroebics dance designed to ease birth will definitely make you and your baby healthier so keep dancing and congratulations on your new child Pregnancy Breastfeeding Madonna (entertainer) Belly dance EastEnders Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show Childbirth Miscarriage Abortion debate Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Brave New World Obstetrics Cliff Richard Stuttering Marie Antoinette Pregnancy fetishism Repetitive strain injury Urinary incontinence Boston Public I Love Lucy Hathor Horus Transsexuality Exercise Multiple birth Aerial (dance move) Sex and the City Humphrey Bogart Mickey Mouse Birth control Melanie Wilkes Jam (TV series) Fecal incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jennifer Lopez English grammar Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Knots Landing The Beatles discography Britney Spears Premature birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Lucille Ball Prenatal diagnosis Elephant Scottish country dance DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Puberty Menstrual cycle Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Abortion George Burns DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution The Prodigy Equine conformation Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Incarnations of Immortality The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Menstrual cup Family Guy Cytomegalovirus God Emperor of Dune Ron and Fez Koala Percy Bysshe Shelley Mission UK English Country Dance Yoko Ono Guinea pig Cat Married... with Children Joan Crawford Our Friends in the North Lindy Hop Tina Turner Woman DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution The McGuire Sisters My Family (television) Michael Jackson Pointe shoes Child sexuality Kodocha Nudity Breech birth Grandview, U.S.A.
