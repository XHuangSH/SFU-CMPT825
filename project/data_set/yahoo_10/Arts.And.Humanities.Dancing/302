the splits v sit sit with your back flat against a wall bring both legs as far back to the wall as you can and keep proper posture and straight legs while keeping your posture bring your back down towards the floor as your arms reach out in front of you not down as far as possible feel the stretch do this first pointing your toes then flexing your feet try moving your legs out further as you go on also you can reach out towards your right and left legs remember to breathe straight leg stretch i don t have a better name for this one basically keep your legs straight and feet together stand and without bending your knees reach down as far as possible put your weight on your toes not your heels this feels a bit unnatural at first but it is the proper way to stretch you can also do this one sitting sit with proper posture legs straight out in front of you and ankles together reach out with your arms do this both flexing and pointing your toes sideways stretch ok so you ve probably figured out that i m making up names for the stretches as i go along pretty creative eh anyway the sideways stretch goes like this stand in the straight leg stretch position now bring your right leg out in front of you like you re taking a step forward about two feet this doesn t have to be precise just as long as you re close stand up keep your posture back now reach down to your right foot keeping your posture back and your hips in line your hips shouldn t shift to aid you in your stretch go down slowly and if you hips shift come back up and try again go as far down as you can without shifting hips after doing this for a minute bend your left leg and continue stretching to your right now switch legs stretch named because it looks like a number sit down on your butt and put both legs straight out in front of you bend your left leg so that your left knee is on the ground your left foot also on the ground with the flat side touching your right knee and your right knee is straight with toes pointed see the that your legs make stretch with proper posture to your right leg reach out with your arms as far as you can after a minute remembering to breathe of course flex your right foot and continue reaching out for another minute switch legs and repeat standing v leg stretch stand up posture back with your legs shoulder width apart you can go a little wider if that s more comfortable for you but try to keep it as close to shoulder width as possible bring your straight arms between and beyond your legs reach back also reach to your right and left legs reach down the center too as with the straight leg stretch keep your weight over your toes rather than your heels half squat squat keep your right leg where it is and place your left leg straight out your left side toes pointed as if you were doing the center splits with your left leg put your right hand on the ground to the left of your right foot use your right elbow to push your right knee out you should feel stretching your inner thighs now flex your feet switch sides the splits well if you want your splits down shouldn t you be doing them never be discouraged by how far you are from the splits just get as close as you can and hold it there for awhile a minute relax and repeat a few times you can also do the splits on the wall preferably a doorway so you can keep your balance in a few days after doing multiple stretches you will notice that you re getting closer rejoice tips if you are fully touching the ground you can try putting your front leg on something elevated like a mat phone book or step wear loose comfortable clothing for most people splits are easier with a particular leg forward so try both ways practice keep trying and don't give up the splits are difficult to achieve but once you have them you'll be the envy of others who haven't accomplished it yet keep toes pointed for best result try a little bit every day if you push yourself too hard you can get hurt it is best if you try doing the splits a couple times a day the key to this is repetition if you do it a lot one day and then don't do it again for days it won't work as well if you want the best results you must do this everyday warnings do not stretch too hard you may pull a muscle do not hold any split too long if it hurts while you need to take the stretch to the edge of pain back off if you feel intense pain or feel something in your leg or hip give this can indicate injury if you are prone to muscle injuries talk to your doctor trainer or coach before attempting a forward split things you ll need try using some padding underneath you because it makes the splits alot more comfortable but padding isn't required when i strtch i ussually do it on my bed because it doesn't hurt that much ad then once i'm done with the bed i do it on my wooden floor and i put two tea towels under my heel so that it is easier to slide i wish you luck i apologize if the descriptions are hard to follow if
