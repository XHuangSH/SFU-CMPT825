tutu party i have started taking ballet classes among other dance classes with my girlfriend she has notice that i like looking at the other women's bodies but hey i can't help it i'm a guy she says she's ok with it though but she also says i have to attend the annual tutu party all she has told me is that you buy a tutu from this place and the proceeds are donated to charity and then you show up the next week wearing the tutu and dance i'm not too thrilled about the fact that i actually like this ballet thing but my girlfriend seems to think that if i do this i can get over my shyness when it comes to doing ballet in front of people whatever what should i do i think that your girlfriend is playing a little joke on you but i still think you need to wear that tutu this in an odd way will show that you love her and just enjoy looking at other womens bodys just make sure you tell her she has the hottest body out of all of them to make her feel better hope this helps Princess Tutu Desmond Tutu Stewie Griffin Rod Stewart Madonna (entertainer) Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Garth Brooks Can't Hardly Wait The Contender (television series) Funeral George Costanza Sauna E.
