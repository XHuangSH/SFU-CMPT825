dancing dilemma in london help my partner has no rhythm at all he likes music but he can't dance i don't know what to do i've abstained from going dancing long enough now i can't do it anymore i've tried teaching him to dance but the problem is that he doesn't move to the beat at all so what do i do plus i'm a woman and it's hard to teach a man i started teaching him to move to a beat to listen then move sometimes he tries but at some point he just starts doing weired things i would like to go to salsa dancing evenings but i'm not sure what he'll do when we get there i don't want everyone looking at us and laughing i thought of buying him a guitar maybe he might get the beat just a little or just dancing lessons although i'm not sure where to go in london any ideas about what to do please help ahhh i am sorry i know just how you feel because my hubby can't dance the only advice that i can give is for you and him to take some dance lessons with a professional teacher usually someone else like a professional can teach better than someone that is too close to the situation Lindy Hop Glossary of partner dance terms Salsa (dance) West Coast Swing Music of Puerto Rico Caller (dance) Salsa music Cliff Richard Ceroc Transactional analysis Time Out of Mind Boston Public Contredanse Music genre Social rule Scottish country dance Tango (dance) Avenue Q Aesthetic Realism Drum and bass Ranma __ characters Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Partner dance Carlos Castaneda Shaggy dog story Disco Friends Lead and follow (dance) Music Jon Secada Blues Asperger syndrome Past teachings of Prem Rawat Wedding Crashers Martial art Big band Pure Pwnage Flamenco Bart chalkboard gags Alexander Technique Music theory Prisoner's dilemma Dance music W.
