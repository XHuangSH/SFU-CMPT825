going to try a bellydancing class i was just wondering do i have to bare my midriff in order to do it i have very good abs work out a lot but i'm just very shy about the whole thing couldn't i just wear something form fitting that still covers me becka lol no thankfully for the rest of the world i am not going to be a professional bellydancer i'm just a writer who thought it might be fun no you don't have to wear anything that bares your midriff unless you want to do so i usually wear jazz or yoga pants with a hip sash and a top the type of top depends on my mood and the time of year i tend to wear more crop tops in summer than in winter the important thing is to wear something comfortable that does not constrict movement if possible you may want to contact the teacher ahead of time and find out what she may suggest and ask any other questions you may have about the class and what to expect even if you were to perform there are lots of beautiful costumes that do not bare your midriff just one example http www thebellydanceshop com proddetail php prod ec Swimsuit Japanese tea ceremony Customs and etiquette of Japan Irish dance Baseball The Shining (film) Hasidic Judaism The Ashlee Simpson Show Lindy Hop Kimono Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Infantilism Car handling Tai Chi Chuan Current teachings of Prem Rawat Trousers Equine conformation Fast bowling The Emancipation of Mimi T'Pol Emotions (album) Drag racing Sari Corset Avenue Q Brassiere Grammatical mood Milton H.
