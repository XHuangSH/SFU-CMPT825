how long do you will i get on pointe just started doing beginners ballet and been doing it for months yrs old took summer intensive can do right split and left split almost taking ballet class time a week only because of my schedule my ballet teacher said i have a natural turnout and flexible putting my heart into ballet and doing my best been writing the alphabet with my feet and just this morning my ballet teacher asked me starting next week that i''ll join the class of a higher level and attend in my level the answer is different for everyone some dancers don't have the right bone structure in their foot and ankle to ever go on pointe some teachers still put these students on pointe to keep the student and parents happy without taking into consideration the long term damage they are doing to them i've been teaching for years and teaching pre pointe and pointe for about i'm not saying that my criteria is correct but this is just one teacher's opinion minimum of ballet technique classes and pre pointe class per week i recommend more but this is the absolute minimum understanding of correct ballet posture and being able to correct to own body uderstanding what is special about their body sway back hyperextended knock knees bow legged etc and be able to work towards self correcting no sickle whatsover way too dangerous to be on pointe if you sickle being able to keep correct posture alignment and turnout during all exercises controlled grand plie au mileau hold a releve for a minute without wobbling with weight properly distributed through the entire releve being able to execute controlled releves passes in the centre flexible ankle nice arch no attitude problem if a student isn't willing to learn slow and pay attention to everything being taught they could be in danger of doing things in correctly and injuring themselves achieved growth spurt can happen anywhere from usually ballet for at least years as a teacher it's usually obvious when the student is developing enough strength to be on pointe but you need to examine their bare feet as well is the nd toe bigger than the st are there any big gaps between any of the toes do they have a really high arch which is hard for a beginner to control on pointe without the proper ankle strength to support it bunions is the big toe abnormally long are all the toes long usually fragile i would say that you are on the right track for sure with your training i wouldn't consider pointe until you are in at least classes per week you say it's because of your schedule which is fine if you are taking dance classes for fun and as a form of exercise if you want to pointe safely and correctly you really need to be training more please be patient usually dancers who start pointe a little later or progress faster than ones that start too early i have many students that started ballet at and years old but took classes per week they started pointe around they are now and in the same classes as year olds who started pointe at and years old be patient and listen to your teacher's opinion he she just wants what is best for you best of luck with your studies Equine conformation Glossary of ballet terms Weight training Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling holds Diving Glossary of partner dance terms Irish dance High-heeled shoe Martial art Aikido Education in the People's Republic of China Figure skating Urinary incontinence Pointe shoes Education in Romania Marching band Fencing Prostate cancer Graduate school Education in the United States Swimming Paragliding Diabetes mellitus Education in Japan Alexander Technique GED Ceroc Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Human position Chinese martial arts Parachuting Kitesurfing Puberty Rail terminology Past teachings of Prem Rawat Social rule The Book of Five Rings Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Japanese tea ceremony Theory of conduct Education in Portugal Anchor Kurt Angle Education in Hong Kong Contredanse West Coast Swing Taekwondo Columbine High School massacre Foot Mixed martial arts Fast bowling Dog agility Cancer Massage Backstroke Traumatic brain injury SAT Education in Germany Asperger syndrome Turner syndrome Fertility awareness First aid Anorexia nervosa Running Spanking Tenshinhan Modern dance National Certificate of Educational Achievement Hypertension Swingout Dog training Characters of Naruto Car handling Androgen insensitivity syndrome Iliotibial band syndrome Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Piccolo Junior Saga Lindy Hop Meditation No Child Left Behind Act Scientology beliefs and practices The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Homeschooling Qigong A Course In Miracles Redundant array of independent disks Growth hormone treatment Wing Chun Childbirth Volleyball Shaggy dog story Violin Chair
