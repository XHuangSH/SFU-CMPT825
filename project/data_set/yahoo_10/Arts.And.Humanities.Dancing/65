doesn't harm joints i love dancing i used to do loads but had to give it up cos i kept spraining my ankle really badly and my mum refused to let me go back that was a few years ago now though and i really want to get back into dancing is there a form of dancing other than belly oriental dancing that isn't as intense on your joints esp ankles thanks x dancing like running and aerobics puts stress on your joints because of 'shearing forces' the side to side stresses as someone who knackered the cartilege in my knees playing rugby i'd say this if you build muscle strength around the affected joint it can really help i still squat over kg and cycle miles or more every week i'd suggest you build your calf strength with four exercises to hit the muscle you can see on the back of your leg do calf raises going up on your toes whilst holding a weight but do it three ways with your feet straight out turned in and turned out calf muslces are really tough 'cos we use em all the time so you will prob' need to exercise till it really hurts to see the benefit usual rules apply muscle pain is fine but stop if you feel anything else the other thing is that the soleus calf muscle doesn't work unless your knees are bent so you'll need to do calf raises sitting down it's the gastronemeus that you can see at the back of your leg scuse spelling and that works when your knees are locked my hunch is that the soleus is where you can really build some stability for your ankle as it's the muscle structure that wraps all the way around your lower legs if you can't find a gym with the right machine then just use a bench and put weights on your knees and lift em again by going up on your toes i'm guessing you're a girl and if that's so then don't worry about getting all muscular and 'not feminine' you don't have the testosterone required to gain muscle in the way that guys do and it also means you probably don't get zits like us or die years earlier or suffer from road rage i know this is somewhat away from your question but really dancing is always gonna be tough on your joints but you can do it if you just address where you're weakest you might also try a spoonfull of hemp oil every day it doesn't taste omg awful like cod's liver oil doesn't have cadmium and other heavy metals that the poor old cod's liver has been straining out of our polluted seas and has a natural balance of the omega types so you can actually absorb it it tastes like nuts to me and it has really helped me i use an organic one but then i'm kinda precious i hear glucosamine is cool too though i haven't tried it i understand though that the off the shelf varieties are crap see if you can get your doc' to prescribe it for you huh stilll at last to get back to your actual question if you were actually spraining your ankle then you can strengthen your lower legs with these exercises in a few weeks you will find it hard to sprain anything if it is a cartilege issue then similaraly strengthening the musculature in your lower legs will soak up some damage as will the supplements and you can crazy legs or tango to your heart's content Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Diving Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Osteoarthritis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Professional wrestling attacks Muscle Swimming Urinary incontinence Squat (exercise) Suplex Spanking Terminal ballistics Doom enemies Soleus muscle Mixed martial arts Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Skateboarding trick Fecal incontinence Massage Repetitive strain injury Seismic retrofit Horse Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Running Omega-3 fatty acid Childbirth Aikido Exercise Bodybuilding Swingout Prostate cancer Decompression sickness Figure skating Chronic fatigue syndrome High-heeled shoe Glossary of climbing terms Stress fracture Bicycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.
