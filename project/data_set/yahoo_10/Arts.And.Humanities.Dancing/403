above how about you me and my boyfriend had an stupid arguement about why people go to club he thinks most of the people go to club is to meet some body and to u know and that is why people dress up and go to club as for my answer i just like going to club to have fun i don't think there is something wrong with going to club with your friends even if you're in a relationship or not and as for dressing up because there is a dress code and who would want to look like a crap going to club maybe my bf is right on some parts but i don't think all people actually just go to club to meet somebody and get busy or is it different people go to clubs with different main goal in mind maybe his would be to meet someone yours is just to be in the loud crowd and get your energy level up as for dressing up dressing up makes you feel better it creates the mood but he has a point too if other guys come there with purpose to meet someone and get busy he's worried that you will be the subject while they might be pretending that they are there only to have fun and be in the crowd Social rule Avenue Q Friends Human sexual behavior EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Big Brother UK series 6 Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Rock Follies Sydney Riot of 1879 Megan Griffin Craps Phoebe Buffay's songs Kodocha Piccolo Junior Saga FoxTrot Kyle Broflovski Marie Antoinette T.A.T.u.
