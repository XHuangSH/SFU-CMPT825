is it bad to have a fringe when you do dancing i have a fringe that is almost long enough to pull back into a ponytail it's a pain for dancing because we are not allowed to have hair in our faces i always have to pin my fringe back and it gets annoying people say i look better with a fringe should i grow it out for dancing i can't wear it it's against the rules it's all about giving it up for dancing slick your fringe bangs back down with hair gel then spray it with a strong holding hair spray you probably take a shower shampoo right after you are finished dancing so you won't have to worry about it clogging your pores just clean your forehead face really good after spraying the hair spray you don't want to clog up your pores ps many famous dancers have had a fringe bangs perhaps once they became famous they were able to wear their hair how they pleased whether you grow it out or keep it the way it is should be entirely up to you Haircut Ponytail Comanche Professional wrestling match types Hair Baldness Dreadlocks Joy (novel) Kodocha Pepper spray Beard Shampoo Kurt Angle Totally Spies!
