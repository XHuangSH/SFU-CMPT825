ballet hip hop and which tap or jazz my daughter years old took ballet and tap combo classes for years when she was younger then took two years off from dance for other activities she's going back to a new studio this year and really wants to take hip hop and i told her she must take ballet if she's going to dance at all that leaves the third class would you recommend tap or jazz right now it's a hobby but she has expressed some interest in competition or school dance team in the future she's torn i could go either way the dance director said either is fine but we just want to decide personally i would do tap because that's my best but if she's interseted in a team she would be more likely to take jazz jazz is a wider selection in things to do then tap is if she's torn i would say do jazz becuase most girls by their teens drop tap becauses if you don't get it or not into it it's not much fun so they will stop jazz is a bigger area in doing things she will find that jazz is more popular then tap then in competitions jazz is better understood then tap is trust me doing tap solos duos and groups is harder then in jazz so i a girl a few years older would recomend jazz good luck in your search Lindy Hop Aerial (dance move) The Chemical Brothers Music genre Jazz dance Hip hop culture Music of Puerto Rico Alternative hip hop Irish dance Duran Duran Jazz Tap dance Spice Girls Circle (dance move) Rhythm and blues Hip hop collaborations Freestyle music Herbie Hancock World music OutKast Glossary of partner dance terms Grammy Award Gwen Verdon This Is Spinal Tap Electronic music Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Tai Chi Chuan Destiny's Child En Vogue The Beach Boys Blues Missy Elliott Figure skating Trip hop Our Gang Pop music Back to the Future House music Australian jazz Pete Rock Music of the United States Quincy Jones Hip hop music Disc jockey Modern dance Diana Ross Record producer Boyz II Men Lindy Basic Music of France British hip hop Kodocha Hall & Oates Swedish hip hop Grammy Awards of 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards Drum and bass Music of Ireland Arts in Birmingham Timeline of trends in music (1980-1989) ABBA Beastie Boys Music history of the United States John Coltrane Van Halen TLC Australian rock Selling out J-pop The Isley Brothers Journey (band) Acid jazz Beyonc__ Knowles Roaring Twenties Phil Collins African American music Swingout Music of Nigeria French hip hop Bj__rk Chick Corea Jacob's Pillow Kylie Minogue Tony Bennett Intelligent dance music Black Sabbath The Lovely Bones KRS One Music of Minnesota Shawn Michaels Jazz dance moves Grammy Awards of 2003 Ballroom dance Usher (entertainer) Music of South Africa Dru Hill Miss Saigon Salsa music
