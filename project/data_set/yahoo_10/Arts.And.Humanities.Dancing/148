i want to start danceing i want to join a dnaceing school the problem is im i took danceing when i was and havent sense i live in louisiana i want to start danceing but im and i really dont no how and i dont wanna be in a class with a bunch of little kids i dont want to go pro but i want to be on a dance team or some kinda of school any sugestions hei kid i run a dance studio but unfortunately in bulgaria faraway from you if you come for a vacation over here i'll teach you some great moves but for now what i suggest you to do is find a dance studio where they teach 'american social style of latin and ballroom dancing' they are usually named after some great dancers for example gene kelly fred aster and so on they have these special programs of going to classes on your on with an instructor then when and if ready joining a class on your own dance level my studio actually is one of that kind its very successful here bacause many people who are shy can dance only with an instructor and to learn without having the whole class staring at them i guess if youre youre tall enough to dance with a privite instructor you havent specified the style of dancig you want to learn i recommend you the ballrooms and the latinamericans because they also develope a whole attitude to partners and to live wich is a great benefit they are fun to dance and many of the modern american styles in dancing are based on them or connected in some ways it doesnt mean you will not be a great dancer just alone good luck Ballroom dance Glossary of partner dance terms West Coast Swing Tango (dance) Dance Contredanse Lead and follow (dance) Modern dance Aerial (dance move) Fred Astaire Caller (dance) Modern Western square dance Swing (dance) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Tap dance Scottish highland dance AFI 100 Years series English Country Dance The Adventures of Pete & Pete Martial art Belly dance Ceroc Gwen Verdon Partner dance Square dance club Music of Ireland Jacob's Pillow Graduate school Scottish country dance Arthur Murray Asperger syndrome Breakdancing Sheryl Crow Scooby-Doo Gene Kelly Strictly Come Dancing You Were Never Lovelier Participation dance Bilkent University Swingout Glossary of ballet terms Irish dance Saved by the Bell Single certification Dancing at Lughnasa Billy Elliot Dance of the United States Highland games Alexander Technique Education in the United States Boston Public Experiential education Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Line dance Ice dancing The Chemical Brothers Frankie Manning Aaliyah Roaring Twenties Round dance Singlish DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Air Education and Training Command Morphogenetic field Marching band The Ashlee Simpson Show Jazz dance Special education CPU cache Homeschooling Aikido Hall & Oates Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Tom and Jerry (MGM) Second language acquisition Jennifer Lopez Parachuting Ruby Keeler New York Giants The Beach Boys Marathon dancing Friends Square dance Royal Wedding Modern Jive Georgia Institute of Technology Drill instructor Carl Barks History of dance Prom Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMIX Comedy film Pow-wow Shall We Dance (1996 film) Professor Tiny Toon Adventures
