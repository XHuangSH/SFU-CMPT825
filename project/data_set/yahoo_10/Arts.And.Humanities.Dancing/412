do you have to go to dance class inorder to audtition for music video's and things and how will it be like to audtiton you may just have natural talent and that is a wonderful gift i would recommend watching dance classes to see how you feel about the lessons do you think you would enjoy classes try small venues like small clubs etc to get used to performing under pressure then you can start doing auditions but just go for the practice don't expect anything except to get some experience auditioning the more you practice and audition the more your confidence will soar Music Lindy Hop Napoleon Dynamite Kylie Minogue Australian jazz Morning Musume The Jackson 5 Modern Western square dance Tori Amos Whitney Houston Scientology beliefs and practices Britney Spears The Monkees Enrique Iglesias En Vogue Paula Abdul Music Hall Shaggy dog story House music King Crimson John Cage Fame Academy Madonna (entertainer) Beavis and Butt-head Red Hot Chili Peppers Genesis (band) Duran Duran Hip hop culture American Idol Journey (band) Meat Loaf Depeche Mode ISO 9000 Remix National Audit Office History of SNL:1980-1985 Prince (artist) European classical music Elijah Wood Captain Beefheart Rush (band) Jon Secada Carpenters Crazy in Love Jazz History of the Beatles Jennifer Lopez The Gathering (band) Disc jockey Magic (illusion) We Belong Together Gliding Van Halen Eddie Murphy Milton H.
