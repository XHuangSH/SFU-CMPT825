do people change shoes when going swing dancing thanks to your advice i did purchase brand new mary jane's from aris allen looking at the suede soles i started thinking about walking on the street aack is it normal to carry dancing shoes into a club and change inside or is the suede tougher than it looks able to endure pavement outside thx i usually change there too if anything just to make them last longer when swing dancing or dancing of any kind for that matter it is imperative to have comfortable shoes that don't cramp your feet but to answer you i think it is perfectly fine to change once your inside and if anyone asks just tell them you like your shoes to last Shoe Swingout Tap dance Equine conformation High-heeled shoe Ruby Keeler Contredanse West Coast Swing Zazou George Burns Walking Timeline of alternative rock Babe Ruth Cliff Richard Golf Irish dance Barefoot Professional wrestling match types Stairway Punt (boat) Jon Secada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Opportunity rover Blackjack Sears Holdings Corporation Boxing Fast bowling Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Swing (dance) Wedding Crashers Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
