dance ok so i have years of experience in ballet and i was wanting to start contemporary dance but i was wondering if it was a whole lot different than ballet like the clothing music etc if there are any contemporary dance studios in southern ohio ohh and could you also give me information about lyrical dance there is the contemporary classical dance theater in ohio not sure if it's southern but the website http www ohiodancetheatre org school staff faculty html there is the contemporary dance theater in cincinnati http www cdt dance org contemporary is very different from ballet it's most different from any other style of dance it's about expression so the music and clothes vary depending on mood and perception trying to be portrayed it's fun and free spirited but also hard and not fit for everyone for you however with a background of ballet i think you'll find it pleasant easy and a good way to expand you dancing horizon have fun and good luck fall classes start in sept answer to your second lyrical is my favorite always has been it's a good mix of ballet and jazz dance techniques as well as rock punk swing modern it's very expressional wikipedia has the best explianation the lyrics of a song are the driving force for the inspiration of the movement choreography is often emotional gripping and delicate all at the same time lyrical is not just a form of dance for many it is a way of expressing your emotions lyrical is typically dance to a song about freedom or releasing any sort of sad emotion but can be choreographed to any human emotion related song lyrical may or may not be graceful but always will be emotional and unpredictable this style of dance is generally not based on technique as are ballet and jazz on the contrary lyrical is based around choreography and the interpretation of the music routines are based around feeling and emotion and though technique is essential spirit generally tells where the dance will go movements in lyrical dance are characterized by their fluidity and grace leaps are executed high and with a soaring quality turns are airy and flowing when the music's tone is angry or frustrated dancers use sharp short movements anger is also an emotion often seen in lyrical in routines based around anger it is common for the jazz portions and styles of lyrical to come out however when it is happy or peaceful dancers use lighter more flowing movements very important in lyrical is the continuation of movements and moves this means that the dancer does not simply finish a move and be done a lyrical dancer would hold out the movement for as long as possible and have smooth transitions between others having used this continuation of movement the dancer may stop or incorporate sharp moves into their routine for emphasis although lyrical is stereotypically choreographed to music that is slow or downbeat it is a very broad form of dance upbeat aggressive styles of music are occasionally used music can be of any genre pop rock and even hip hop r b styles are popular for choreographing Dance Aerial (dance move) Modern dance Glossary of partner dance terms Hip hop culture Jazz Blues Heavy metal music Music of Ireland American popular music Pop music Swingout West Coast Swing Music radio Musical film Music history of the United States Music Classical music era Fast bowling Marching band Romantic music Jazz dance Irish dance Postmodern music Ballroom dance Emo Hip hop music Funk Lead and follow (dance) Music of Germany Ska Freestyle music Folk music David Bowie Capoeira Music of the United States Gothic rock Bj__rk Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Timpani Popular music Music of Australia Martial art Violin Rhythm and blues Rapping Native American music Aikido History of dance Alternative hip hop Glossary of ballet terms Theatre Salsa music 20th century classical music Asperger syndrome Figure skating Jerome Robbins Swing (dance) The Ashlee Simpson Show Bradley Nowell Breakdancing Music of Louisiana Tonality Belly dance Double bass Musical theater Music of Cuba Jennifer Lopez Drum and bass Sylvia (ballet) Ballet Bass guitar Dance of the United States Punk rock Modernism Trip hop Anchor Nu metal Jethro Tull (band) Death rock Music of Nigeria Emotions (Mariah Carey song) Jacob's Pillow Mixtape Cantopop Music of Bangladesh Circle (dance move) African American music House music
