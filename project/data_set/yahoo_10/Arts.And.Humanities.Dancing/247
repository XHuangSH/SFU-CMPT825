what is the right age for belly dance my girls r any age is right to start bellydancing my daughter started at one but it was in the home just like most people in the middle east the children learn it from their mothers aunts sisters cousins and even grandmothers it's never to early to start having fun with your kids but a formal class would probably be more productive when they are older if you can find a class for children then a younger age is fine but most bellydance classes are geared towards adults and will not be a very good match for such a young child they will be easily bored and frustrated in a class such as this and will likely become a nuisence to the other members of the class if you can't find a childrens class just do it at home with your kids for fun you may even want to buy some arabic kids music like free baby which will be easier for them to really get into kids especially love their song baba fein for adult classes children should be at least around years of age although some children mature faster or are more responsible and could be given exceptions Child Belly dance Pride and Prejudice Our Gang About a Boy The Fairly OddParents Kodocha Baby Blues Kylie Minogue Generation Y Family Rugrats Neighbours Charmed Statutory rape The Adventures of Pete & Pete Spice Girls Mnemonic Transactional analysis Kimberly-Clark Corporation Little Snow Fairy Sugar Avenue Q Incest The Beach Boys Ellen Foster Melanie Wilkes Luke and Laura Spencer Cardcaptor Sakura Sheryl Crow Motion picture rating system Adolescence Emperor Cheng of Han Disney's California Adventure Murdock-Portal Elementary School For Better or For Worse W.I.T.C.H.
