should i list belly dancing among my hobbies when i apply for a university in the us or would it be considered offensive or immoral i'm quite good at belly dancing the art not just shaking your butt u know i definitely would a college admissions office would recognize it as a legitimate art form besides many colleges universities are looking for cultural diversity on their campuses and want students that bring something unique to the school showing that you are well versed and have an interest in different cultures and the arts can only help you if nothing else it's a great talking point for an interview good luck Georgetown University Johns Hopkins University Brown University Belly dance College admissions Boston College Rutgers University Trinity College, Dublin Cornell University College University Affirmative action University of Connecticut University of California, San Diego California Polytechnic State University Franklin W.
