is take private student loan worthed to go to georgia tech hi the reason why i need to take that much loan is because i applied for fanicial aid late and because me and my family moved to the united states less tha a year ago so i was told i am going to have an out of state tuition just for this year as long as my family continute living in georgia i will become an instate student meaning lesser tuition so my question is is it worthed to take just for one year so that i can go to georgia tech that depends is georgia tech the best school for the major degree you are pursuing if it is then it would seem to be worth it if you are going to be getting in state residency status the following year it seems that in any school you attend in georgia you will have to pay out of state tuition until your residency is established for in state tuition what about getting some of your basic courses out of the way at a community college http www usg edu inst if that is a route you may want to pursue talk to an admissions officer at georgia tech to see which school around atlanta you could attend that would have the needed courses transfer to georgia tech good luck in whatever decision you make Student loan Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Tuition Graduate school Georgia Institute of Technology Education in Australia Virginia Military Institute Community college Juris Doctor Law school College Education in Portugal Scientology beliefs and practices Culture of the United States Gwinnett University Center __cole Polytechnique Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University State university Georgetown University Brown University University of Bristol University of Michigan Private school Education in Taiwan California Polytechnic State University Cornell University United States Massachusetts Institute of Technology Georgia (U.S. state) Education in Hong Kong Auburn University Higher School Certificate Franklin W.
