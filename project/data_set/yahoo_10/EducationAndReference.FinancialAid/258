i recently received a scholarship that will pay for tuition and books i also have a pell grant and a stafford loan plus another student loan from sallie mae i found out that the college cancelled the sallie mae student loan why did they do this and why wasn't i able to keep it i will be the one to have to pay it back the financial aid office would have been the one's to cancel your sallie mae signature loan and be glad the reason we cancel or adjust loans and other aid when you receive additional scholarships and grants is because we can't allow you to have aid over your cost of attendance depending on the types of aid and amounts the school will determine what gets cancelled adjusted first in most cases the private loan will always be adjusted first again be glad private loans have high variable interest rates that are not tax deductible and are just plain a bad bargain if you have other options Student loan Education in the United States Financial aid Tuition Education in New Zealand Taxation in the United States Life insurance Scholarship Insurance Tertiary education fees in Australia Subsidy Education in the People's Republic of China 401(k) School choice Microeconomics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Germany Bond United States Postal Service Debt Interest Federal National Mortgage Association United Kingdom corporation tax Bretton Woods system Mortgage-backed security Gross domestic product College admissions Supply and demand Students' union Price discrimination FairTax Graduate school Debt consolidation Education in Japan Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Money Public education Surplus value Affirmative action British universities Government National Mortgage Association Capitalism Interest rate Dalhousie Student Union Variable universal life insurance Inflation University of Rochester Cornell University GED Weighted average cost of capital Top-up fees Health insurance Food Stamp Program Flat tax SAT Evan Mecham Keynesian economics Culture of the United States Islamic banking Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Neocolonialism Economy of El Salvador Bank Hyperinflation Economy of Russia Capital gains tax Microcredit Deficit spending Gold standard Financial endowment Pitzer College Economics Collateralized mortgage obligation Barbara Boxer Grove City College Personal finance Labour economics Citigroup Developing countries' debt Employee stock option Economy of Pakistan Deflation (economics) Tax Higher Education Bill Savings and loan association Corporation Capital accumulation Profit Atari 8-bit family Federal Reserve History of post-Soviet Russia Security (finance) Education in Hong Kong Donald Trump
