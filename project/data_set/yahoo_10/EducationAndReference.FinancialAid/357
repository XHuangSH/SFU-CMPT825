le cordon bleu is it worth the money i am thinking of attending but i do not know what type of financial aide is available i was wondering once graduated can you come out as a soux chef my son will be attending in october taking the baking and patisserie class this school is extremely expensive but you have to consider that this is a private school think about all what you're getting and that will somewhat ease your mind about the tuition the first person who answered you said it wasn't worth the cost and to attend a community college my son did this for two years while in high school and though he learned the basics in the kitchen he didn't learn enough being a graduate from le cordon bleu will get you a foot in the door in any food industry in the world if you want to move to another city and there's a school in the area all you have to do is walk in and say you're a graduate and they will assist you in getting a job as for financial aid my son is applying for financial aid and he just got approved for the first fiscal year including his rent for the time he'll be in school sallie mae is handling everything if you live near a le cordon bleu make an appointment with an admissions counselor to tour the school you will be impressed as for the soux chef i don't know about that because like i said my son is taking baking and patisserie but it wouldn't surprise me if you could get hired as one my husband flew my son to new york in november for the chocolate show and my son met keegan food network and jacques torres famous chocolatier he has pictures with both of them and it was the highlight of his trip you'll get much more respect being a grad from le cordon bleu than a regular community college i highly recommend you look further into this to let you make your own decision Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Julia Child Epcot Le Cordon Bleu Education in Romania College admissions Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany GED Tuition Education in England Japanese tea ceremony Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action Community college Education in Australia University of Bristol Berkshire Hathaway Economics Education in Portugal Friends Warren Buffett John J.
