best job s while going to college full time i am entering my sophmore year and had one small campus job my first year currently over the summer and a little of the last semester i've worked at a campus health position i was wondering if there are any jobs that might be best for a college kid to do there are a lot of prepare home mailings and be a millionaire scams out there so i'm looking for something that might be at my own pace however not be super stressful or time consuming i am a huge financial worrier and am just trying to find stuff that pays well for college kids and can work around our hours it seems that if you live off campus student loans goign to tuition costs and your parents aren't well off that you sort of get bogged down by the cost of living and school yet to make good money you need to go to school i have a small scholarship as well thank god and i certainly don't waste money on stupi dthings i e games cds car upgrades thanks all for your help sorry its long and confusing i'm in college and this is what i do trust me you'll thank me later be a tutor i help people with math because that is my strong subjuect i just charge and hour which most people can afford and i tutor people at a time for an hour so you potentially can make around in an hour i just put up a little ad nothing fancy around campus it's easy if you just have a little patience and realize that you are making anywhere from an hour i'm sure you'll find it easier than flipping burgers good luck Graduate school Education in the United States Student loan Tuition Education in Germany Franklin W.
