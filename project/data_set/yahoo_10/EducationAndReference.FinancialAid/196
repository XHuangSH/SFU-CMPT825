how can i make extra money with my student loan is there any way that i can make some money with my student loan so i can buy a cheap car after you've covered tuition room board books then you might consider investing of course you can just as easily lose money rather than make money if you want to do it quickly then you need to focus on assets that can be liquidated easily like stocks or commodities like oil pork bellies foreign currencies etc in order to generate profit you're going to have to be able to predict what's likely to go up quickly which means you're going to be looking at something that is likely to be volatile in price that means the investment is likely to be more risky as well all in all unless you have experience in trading and a good sense of the market unlikely if you're in here shopping for advice on this topic you're better off using the leftover for a small down payment on an inexpensive car and financing the rest just get a decent part time job to cover the payments and expenses of owning a car insurance gas maintenance etc Arbitrage Commodity markets Bond Derivative (finance) Futures contract Insurance Monetary policy Mutual fund Inflation Deflation (economics) Money Finance Security (finance) Stock Economy of the United States Bank Corporate finance Economy of Russia Gold standard Gross domestic product Capitalism Personal finance Great Depression Hyperinflation Government debt Microeconomics Keynesian economics Short selling Speculation PE ratio Money supply Economy of Pakistan United Kingdom corporation tax Stock market Economy of Romania Life insurance Economy of Nigeria Bretton Woods system Corporation Economics Interest Supply-side economics Asian financial crisis Free trade Surplus value Citigroup Tax Debt Financial markets Health insurance Federal Reserve 401(k) Investment bank Economy of Africa Privatization Economy of Venezuela Temasek Holdings Economy of Kuwait Toronto-Dominion Bank History of the United States (1918-1945) Financial capital Euro Economy of Chile Foreign exchange market Warren Buffett Institutional fund management Economy of the Philippines Day trading Annuity Balance of payments Economic relations of Japan Student loan Tesco Economy of the Netherlands Monetarism Rational pricing Mortgage Eugene Fama Predatory lending Wal-Mart Graduate school Mergers and acquisitions Economy of Argentina Economy of Bulgaria Gold as an investment Mikhail Khodorkovsky Hedge fund Technical analysis Fractional-reserve banking Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Exchange rate Anarchism and capitalism Collateralized debt obligation Productive and unproductive labour
