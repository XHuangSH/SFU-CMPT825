student loans i have a couple of questions regarding loans and schloarships here is some background info i want to transfer to transfer to a less expensive college in the winter term so i would be leaving my current school after this month having just earning my associate degree in computer information security my grace period to my best knowledge would start in sept march months so if i attend school in the winter at the other school and pay up front would my loans halt since i am in school with the grace perid or would i have to pay them back after the grace period while attending another school if i were to earn a scholarship grant could i apply that towards my loan debt any help would be apprecaitedtowards some of my decisions in this matter if i understand your question i think i am in a good position to answer as long as the school you are transferring to is accredited or to simplify things as long as the school you are transferring to is set up to receive federal funds you will not go into repayment you won't go into repayment until after you complete your degree or withdraw and there is probably some fine print stuff i am not familiar with if you got a scholarship that paid you cash you could use it as you pleased but it would have to be huge money otherwise you'd have to take out debt to pay for the remainder of your education and then what would be the point if you are worried about debt and you should be and you are lucky enough to get a scholarship use it to pay tuition and expenses and save anything left over that debt isn't going anywhere and you have a grace period before interest comes due assuming all your debt is currently in subsidized staffords any grants you get institutional or otherwise aren't going to make for a surplus that would allow you to pay down your previous debt i don't care how low your efc is but if that should happen write a book explaining what you did and than save that surplus until you go into repayment or begin accruing interest there's no need to pay it back until it starts costing you money in interest to clarify the first point the federal government doesn't give grant money ect to just any school calling itself an institution of higher learning that's not to suggest that higher education at accredited institutions isn't a scam to some degree but i digress anyhow make sure your new school is set up to receive federal aid that is is recognized by the federal government as an institution worthy of aid funds and meeting its degree granting requirements Bond Education in the United States Credit card Tertiary education fees in Australia Mortgage Graduate school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deflation (economics) Tuition Education in the People's Republic of China Debt Monetary policy Life insurance School accreditation FairTax Microeconomics Social Security (United States) Financial aid Gross domestic product Tax Economy of Russia Hyperinflation Government debt Education in Germany U.S. public debt Interest Insurance Scholarship Federal Reserve Marshall Plan Trust (Law) USA Deficit spending Unemployment benefit Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Personal finance United Kingdom corporation tax Bretton Woods system No Child Left Behind Act School choice Taxation in the United States Financial markets Flat tax Social Security debate (United States) Academia Community college Treasury security Education in New Zealand Security (finance) Money Barrister 401(k) Keynesian economics Money supply Education in England Education Juris Doctor Divine grace Price discrimination Labor theory of value Inflation Education in Australia Economy of Pakistan School of Salamanca Bank Stock Microcredit Philosophical skepticism Savings and loan association Top-up fees Higher Education Bill Islamic banking Advance fee fraud Short selling Ra (board game) Developing countries' debt Bank fraud College Predatory lending History of the United States (1918-1945) George W.
