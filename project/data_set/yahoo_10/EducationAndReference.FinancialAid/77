what's my best bet with student loans i am returning to school full time i've never taken out student loans before what's my best bet i don't particularly need a whole lot of money just something to help ease the strain of paying for tuition fill out the fafsa and have the results sent to your school they will tell you what you qualify for you may qualify for pell grants or some other form of aid you won't have to repay that will decrease the amount of money that you need to borrow make sure that you talk to the financial aid office about the fact that you'll be in school full time and will not have the same income that you used to when you fill out the fafsa they will ask about your income for last year which can cause you expected contribution to be high even though your income will probably decrease once you're in school usually the financial aid office has been through this before and has a procedure through which you can prove that your income has decreased and appeal the award amount as far as lenders when i went back to school the financial aid office gave me a list of lenders to choose from for my student loans look for a lender who covers the origination fees using one of the lenders on their list meant that they got my money electronically and i got what was left after tuition sooner they'll tell you the maximum you can borrow but if you need less you don't have to take that much good luck Student loan Tuition Financial aid Bond Betting (poker) Mortgage Finance Short selling Bank Predatory lending Insurance Debt Financial markets Graduate school College admissions Annual percentage rate Education in the United States Tertiary education fees in Australia Craps Poker jargon Interest rate Subsidy Usury Education in the People's Republic of China Gold standard Education in New Zealand Unemployment benefit Government National Mortgage Association Economy of Pakistan Inflation Bretton Woods system Deflation (economics) Lender of last resort Stock Top-up fees Government debt Life insurance Developing countries' debt Islamic economics Economy of India Real estate broker Gross domestic product Students' union Money Education in Germany Corporation Debt consolidation Money supply Hyperinflation Dalhousie Student Union Central bank Personal finance Price discrimination Economy of Russia Mergers and acquisitions Payday loan Yield curve 2003 California recall Bank fraud Baccarat Rational pricing Social Security (United States) Monetary policy Scholarship Princeton University __cole Polytechnique Temasek Holdings Public education Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Gambling Article One of the United States Constitution Blackjack Variable universal life insurance Primerica Financial Services Law school Deficit Citigroup Title insurance Debt levels and flows Education in England Barack Obama Higher Education Bill British universities Municipal bond Anarchism and capitalism Margin (finance) Repurchase agreement Fixed income Barbara Boxer Education in Finland Sports betting Tony Blair
