is it ok to use the same essay when applying for diffident scholarships can i just write one or two essays and submit them to a number of different scholarships as long as the topics coincide with what the scholarship is asking for or should i write a new essay for each one i apply for you could do this but i wouldn't recommend this even if the question is the same the scholarships are different if one scholarship is for just an example left handed students and the question is how have you overcome discrimination in your life the best essay would likely discuss the problems with being left handed in a righty world but if you are also applying for a scholarship for children of immigrants and they asked the exact same question your essay should address the discrimination you faced as a st generation american know your audience not just the topic GED Theory of conduct SAT C.
