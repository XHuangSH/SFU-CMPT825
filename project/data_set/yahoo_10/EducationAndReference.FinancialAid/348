stafford loan i am enrolled in courses credit hours and have completed all the federal requirements to obtain a federal stafford loan i am slated to begin classes on however in applying for my financial aid stafford loan the fin aid dept states that i have to take a partial compass test before disbursing any monies to me from a stafford loan stating the admissions process is incomplete the reasoning for a compass test is that all my education is more than years old is in contrast to the degree that i am seeking therefore requiring the compass test however i am seeking a waiver of the remaining portions of the compass test based on work history etc my question is if i am not admitted how is it possible that i am able to enroll take classes if the federal government doesn't require a test for loans as long as i have met the requirements fin need eligible degree program enrollment etc am actively pursuing a degree can the school not disburse the it sounds like the compass test is required to complete the admission process at your school and since you havent completed it they havent been able to check off that box on their form to say you are fully admitted you will need to talk with the person at your school where you are seeking the waiver to let them know that this decision is holding up the dispursement of your financial aid award they should get the decision finalized before your classes start if the government will not dispurse the money to them until all admissions paperwork is completed then they do not have the money to give you yet and what is the problem with taking the test anyway if you have work experience with the material then you should be able to pass a test on it good luck and it will likely be figured out before you start classes Education in the United States College admissions Law school Student loan Juris Doctor Education in Hong Kong Education in Australia Education in Germany United States Naval Academy Financial aid Master's degree Medical school Community college Immigration to the United States Unemployment benefit Education in Romania Monetary policy Credit card Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Portugal Grade (education) Extreme Programming Money supply GED Appeal Cornell University Attorney at Law Physician School accreditation Brown University Annuity Education in Malaysia Lawyer Architect IB Diploma Programme United States Air Force Academy No Child Left Behind Act Affirmative action Economy of the United States Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Driver's license SAT Expert system The Amazing Race College Education Education in Austria Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Equal Protection Clause Middle Tennessee State University Economy of Nigeria Economics 401(k) Homeschooling Virginia Military Institute Halting problem Capitalism Education in Finland Bretton Woods system Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Law School Admissions Test Stevens Institute of Technology Education in Sweden Marshall Plan Bush v.
