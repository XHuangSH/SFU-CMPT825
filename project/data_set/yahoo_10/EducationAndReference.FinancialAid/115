i need help finding a lender for a private college in france i am a us citizen who is foreign enrolled at a private graduate film school in paris fr which does not offer any sort of financial aid to their students it is too late for scholarships and grants im looking for private student loans i am coincadentally in the same boat as you except i'm not officially enrolled yet because i want to secure financial aid first what school are you going to if you don't mind my asking i've been looking into the eicar the obvious first route to go through is always the fafsa especially since they tend to give more money to grad students and offer things like gradplus loans and sometimes you can even obtain loans through the fafsa for foreign schools that are eligible unfortunately no film school in paris is i checked online and even talked with the department of education on the phone to double check there are a few private education lenders like sallie mae etc that have the option of selecting a foreign approved school but this list is usually the same list as those approved by the department of education the schools that tend to be on these lists are either public medical law or business schools there is also the international student loan network which offers private loans for foreign enrolled students their list of approved schools was longer than other lists i've seen the school i was looking for wasn't listed but perhaps yours is if you want to check that out if it's not there is the possibility of giving the school the direct number of the lender to get certified through this particular program i haven't gone that route but i'm considering it because it can't hurt the number is located in the faq section good luck Financial aid Student loan Education in the United States College admissions Education in the People's Republic of China Bank Tuition Financial markets Mortgage American University Columbia University University of Central Florida School choice Education in Japan Brown University Georgetown University Education in Hong Kong Ivy League Independent school (UK) Education in Portugal Cornell University Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Charter school Corporation Interest Education in Germany Chinese University of Hong Kong Babson College Finance Education in Australia Bond Yale University Vanderbilt University Stuyvesant High School Classified information Credit card University of Pretoria Higher education in Japan Economy of the United States Johns Hopkins University Seneca College Medical school Paralegal Culture of France No Child Left Behind Act Florida State University Virginia Military Institute Temasek Holdings Privatization Subsidy Education in New Zealand Pennsylvania State University Lyceum of the Philippines Law school Princeton University Education in France University of Szeged Stanford University Marshall University University of Houston University of Virginia University of Southern California Predatory lending Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Education in Romania University of Rochester Bank fraud York University University of North Carolina at Charlotte Government debt Education in Malaysia Lender of last resort Lawyer University Annuity Bumiputra Juris Doctor Duke University Ohio Wesleyan University College and university rankings Far Eastern University Accountancy Education in Austria Donald Trump Public policy Physician Conscription University of Phoenix Education in India Hurricane Katrina disaster relief
