at what age in california are you considered an independent in terms of financial aid ok i'm wondering since i'm pretty old now and was denied financial aid when i was younger b c of my parents can i ever get it again i have no job no money to speak of in my bank account but it seems they always look at my dad's work and say forget you am i old enough yet to apply again and not get denied our govt is so screwed sometimes i have a gpa well unfortunately i can honestly answer no to all those questions next year i'll be starting my ma does that mean i'll get cut from funding for that federal financial aid is the same across the u s the age that you become financially independent from your parents is however there are also other factors which are considered at the beginning of the school year will you be working on a master's or doctorate program such as an ma mba md jd ph d edd or graduate certificate etc as of today are you married do you have children who receive more than half of their support from you do you have dependents other than your children or spouse who live with you and who receive more than half of their support from you now and through june are a both of your parents deceased or b are you or were you until age a ward dependent of the court are you currently serving on active duty in the u s armed forces for purposes other than training are you a veteran of the u s armed forces if you can answer yes to any of these questions you will be considered an independent student for federal financial aid purposes the only difference i am aware of when it comes to state aid in california is that students who are in registered domestic partnerships or students whose parents are in registered domestic partnerships are supposed to have those unions treated the same as a legal marriage in other words for state financial aid a student who is a registered domestic partner would be considered independent however because the federal government does not recognize domestic partnerships they are still considered dependent when it comes to federal student aid i understand your frustration believe me i wish you luck with school by the way when you do become an independent student i would highly recommend applying for the cal grant with no money and a gpa like yours i can't imagine how you wouldn't receive one Same-sex marriage Graduate school Civil union Divorce Marriage Domestic partnerships in California Student loan Education in the United States Same-sex marriage in Canada Education in Germany Civil unions in the United Kingdom Corporation Domestic partnership Federal Marriage Amendment Law school Same-sex marriage in the United States Separation of church and state Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Polyamory Social Security (United States) Common-law marriage Annuity Child support Legal aspects of transsexualism Political subdivisions of New York State Culture of the United States Taxation in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Life insurance Alimony No Child Left Behind Act Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Gross domestic product University of Southern California Age of consent Family College admissions Education in Hong Kong Insurance Scholarship Fathers' rights Charter school Domestic violence Professor Theory of conduct GED Pledge of Allegiance Same-sex marriage timeline Notary public Conscription College Civil rights Juris Doctor Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Tax Who is a Jew?
