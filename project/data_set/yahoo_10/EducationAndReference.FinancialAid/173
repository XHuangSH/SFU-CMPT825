should i consolidate my student loans what are the risks and benefits pros and cons i just graduated with k in student loans and i'm wondering if it's worth it to consolidate or if i should leave my loans as they are my rate is a bit over and my payments which start in december will be about a month i have a friend who is married to a guy in a wheelchair that has always said that she would never consolidate her student loans because if you do your loans aren't forgiven in case of complete disability as her husband's were on the other hand a lower interest rate would be nice what factors should i consider when deciding whether to consolidate if consolidating would be a good choice are there any particular lenders that you would recommend i am assuming these are federal student loans federal student loans stafford plus etc have to be serviced in accordance of what he us dept of ed says this is what consolidastion does regardless of what company locks in the current interest rate you have rounded to the next highest if you have mult interest rates you will get a weighted average since you receive a lower interest rate during in school or in grace it is wise to consolidate during your grace period but at the end of your grace period since consolidations take days to go through it is wise to time your consol smartly apply for your consolidation days before your first payment due date this will ensure that you lock in your current in grace rate and keep your full month grace period now here's what you getting in the mail spam they can offer you a reduction for auto debit from your checking account most student loan comanies do this anyways consolidation or not they can offer a discount for on time payments the us dept of ed uses one company to service their loans that company is william d ford the direct loan program now you can choose to go through someone else but you may face your loan being sold left and right an how can you make on time paymwnts with that i worked for direct loans for years we are scrutized closely by the federal government they made sure we serviced the loans correctly and fairly whomever you choose i would ask a million questions read everything they give and remember that once you've consolidated you cannot re consolidate and you are locked in direct loans ph Student loan Bond Credit card Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Debt consolidation Mortgage Bank Subsidy Monetary policy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Microeconomics Gold standard Government National Mortgage Association Credit score Debt Microcredit Primerica Financial Services Rational pricing Euro Unemployment benefit Social Security debate (United States) Economy of Pakistan Economy of the United States Privatization Gmail Predatory lending Deflation (economics) Publicly funded medicine United States Postal Service Federal National Mortgage Association Wal-Mart Health insurance Short selling Government debt Corporate finance EastEnders Interest Islamic banking Economy of Russia Central bank Password Tertiary education fees in Australia Price discrimination Value added tax Bank fraud Unemployment Bretton Woods system Federal Reserve CPU cache Tax Treasury security $ale of the Century Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Present value Security (finance) Education in the People's Republic of China Taxation in the United States E-mail spam Auto insurance Financial services Finance Graduate school Corporation Hyperinflation Interest rate MetroCard Money Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Mutual fund Municipal bond Donald Trump Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Capital accumulation Internet fraud Financial markets School of Salamanca School bus Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Inflation Annual percentage rate Cable television Education in Germany Divorce Economy of India Betting (poker)
