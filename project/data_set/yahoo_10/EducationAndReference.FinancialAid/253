if you are set to recieve a federal student loan do yu still have to pay tuition and just wait to get it back because of my income they say i dont qualify for grants but they did say that i will be recieving federal student loans but i just want to know if i have to pay first and then wait to get paid back or if once they know i am recieving student loans if they just wait the thirty days till they release it or if i still have to pay it and jsut wait to get it back this all depends how long before classes start that you applied and were approved for the loan if it were after the classes started you would have to make payments to the school until they received your loan money since classes typically start late aug for the fall semester you probably have enough time to wait for the loan to be dispursed check with your financial aid office to be sure though they would be able to give you a more specific answer to your situation Student loan Graduate school Education in the United States Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China Tuition Credit card 401(k) Students' union Financial aid Dalhousie Student Union Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deflation (economics) Taxation in the United States Bond Unemployment benefit Article One of the United States Constitution Princeton University Credit score Tertiary education fees in Australia Mortgage Money Mutual fund Cheque Professor Tax Debt Personal finance Predatory lending Franklin W.
