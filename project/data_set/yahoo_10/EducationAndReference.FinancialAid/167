i filled out a fafsa application in may for the summer semester and because i was still living with my parents i didn't qualify for any financial aid it's still technically the school year but i'm not longer living with my parents i changed the information on my fafsa form but it's been a week and i see no change in how much they think i can pay out what am i doing wrong btw since i live on my own and besides that i'm old enough in the eyes of the government my parents' income has nothing to do with it so why aren't they seeing me as being poor unless you can answer yes to one of the dependency questions on the fafsa and you know what they are since you've already filled it out your parents income will be used to calculate your financial need yes it sucks but we all go through it my parents kicked me out when i told them i was a lesbian that didn't change the fact that i had to use their tax information in order to submit the fafsa of course i could also go into the fact that since my partner of years and i are not allowed to be legally married i'm viewed as a dependent student when i would have become independent a long time ago if we were an opposite sex couple but i digress i do empathize with your situation my suggestion would be to talk to a financial aid adviser if you can get one of them in your corner it could do wonders explain your situation as honestly as possible and ask what they can do for you as you really want to continue your education good luck United Kingdom corporation tax Financial aid College admissions Same-sex marriage in Canada Tuition Theory of conduct Marriage Education in the United States Divorce Student loan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sex education Human sexual behavior Education in Romania God Emperor of Dune Plame affair Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Gross domestic product SAT Same-sex marriage Life insurance Social rule Transsexuality Education in Germany Little Britain Separation of church and state Child sexuality Civil union Paul Martin GED Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Abortion debate Ex-gay Infantilism Tax Scientology beliefs and practices Motion picture rating system Civil unions in the United Kingdom Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Laura Schlessinger One Tree Hill (TV series) Economics Juris Doctor Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Adoption Education in England Piccolo Junior Saga British House of Commons Social Security (United States) Economic inequality Education Karl Rove Legal aspects of transsexualism Polyamory Productive and unproductive labour Jean Grey 2000 Australian Grand Prix Breastfeeding Sharon Tate Academic term Same-sex marriage in the United States French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Expert system Section 28 Contract Normal distribution Supply and demand Capital accumulation Education in Japan Age of consent Sexual orientation Aesthetic Realism National Insurance German student movement Password Code: Lyoko Unemployment Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Democracy Domestic violence MPAA film rating system Professor Strap-on dildo Federal Marriage Amendment Copyright law of the United Kingdom British nationality law Barrister Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Same-sex marriage in Spain U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Inflation 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sin City Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Haven (TNG episode) Negima Futurama (TV series - season 5)
