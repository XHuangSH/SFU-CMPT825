what do i need to get a full ride scholarship i have a or gpa top of my class act i also got a on ap chem test and a on ap bio i have lots of extra curriculars but i don't hold any offices it depends on which type of school you are looking for if you want to go to a private school you will get some scholarships but i don't think a full ride most kids nowadays that get into private schools have the same stats as yourself if not a little worse but if you were to go to a public state school you have a very good chance of getting great offers what year are you now if you are going to be a high school senior this upcoming year than you must take all ap classes and get the best grades possible so often now class rank is the most important factor in college acceptance and scholarships but i think if you keep your options open you will likely get a full ride if not a pretty good amount but with those stats you have a good chance at scholarships so apply to as many as possible College admissions Education in the United States Education in Germany Grade (education) National Certificate of Educational Achievement GED Education in Australia Scholarship Education in Romania SAT Independent school (UK) New Trier High School Student loan RuneScape Education in Taiwan Trinity College, Dublin Ivy League Education in Malaysia Starfleet ranks and insignia Education in Portugal Law school Secondary education in the United States Poker jargon High school Education in Hong Kong Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in New Zealand University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill University of Central Florida Charter school Caulfield Grammar School MapleStory Duke University Affirmative action Medical school Betting (poker) Community college California Polytechnic State University Miami-Dade County Public Schools Boston Public Babson College University of Toronto Norway national football team The College of New Jersey Sam Walton Dr. Michael M.
