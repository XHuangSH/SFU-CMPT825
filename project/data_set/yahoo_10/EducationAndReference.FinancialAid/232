how do i get more money from fafsa if i'm transfering to a bigger school in january i'm going to navarro community college this fall only for this semester and i got a grant from fafsa that covers the cost of navarro but i want to transfer to texas state univeristy for the second semester and since texas state costs more than a community college i'm going to need more money is it possible to re apply for fafsa for a different school i just don't understand how it works you can update your fafsa application by logging into their website www fafsa ed gov you will probably need to have your pin handy update the information also for every year you are in school and want to receive aid you need to resubmit the fafsa to include current information and establish current eligibility even if you have already filled out the fafsa and have already received money from them so even if for some reason you can't get money for the spring term you may be able to get more for the following school year in the meantime you should apply for scholarships so that you can cover as much of the additional costs as possible Financial aid Juris Doctor Academic term Education in the United States College admissions Education in Germany Student loan Education in the People's Republic of China University of Central Florida Kwantlen University College Scholarship Tuition Walt Disney World College Program Tulane University Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Graduate school Life insurance No Child Left Behind Act Middle Tennessee State University World Wide Web Education in Portugal Joe Paterno Economics Texas A&M University Copyright law of the United Kingdom University of Houston Texas Revolution GED Child support Montgomery Blair High School Public domain Carnegie Mellon University Food Stamp Program Elections in the United States Copyright Gross domestic product Legal research Physician Angelo State University Request for Comments Franklin W.
