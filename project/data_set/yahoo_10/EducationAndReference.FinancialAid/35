does financial aid pay your whole tuition if you are a part time student want to start going to school parttime but im not sure if financial aid would pay for it or do i have to come out pocket the answer is possibly depending on your eligibility for aid overall your actual enrollment most students who enroll less than half time usually less than credit hours per term are generally though not always not eligible for enough aid to cover whether or not you are in a degree program and the cost of your school it is a common misconception that students who are not full time are not eligible for aid and not eligible for coverage for tuition fees and books the best way to find out is to do the application and enroll most schools will allow you to drop or withdraw from all courses in the first week without penalty although you do need to ask to ensure you know the policy at your school Student loan Graduate school Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Hong Kong Kwantlen University College Law school Education in Australia __cole Polytechnique Education in Germany Quizbowl Education in France Tuition GED British universities Medicaid Credit card Students' union Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Physician Medicare (United States) Taxation in the United States Community college Brown University Juris Doctor College admissions Virginia Military Institute School choice University of Michigan Unemployment benefit Cornell University Social Security (United States) Professor Life insurance University of British Columbia Alma Mater Society California Polytechnic State University Education in England University of Pretoria North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Centrelink Financial aid Insurance Queen's University 401(k) Higher Education Bill Glossary of American football Education in Malaysia Conscription Affirmative action Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Pennsylvania State University Dalhousie Student Union Education in New Zealand Berea College Public education Food Stamp Program Wal-Mart University of Rochester Higher education in Japan Nurse Certificate of deposit Emerson College Program for the Exceptionally Gifted Primerica Financial Services Education in Singapore Berklee College of Music Education in Japan Seneca College Dalhousie University Franklin W.
