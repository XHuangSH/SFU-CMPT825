petition for reinstatement i have to sign a petition to my old college in order to get reinstated is this a bad thing what does a petition consist of any advice would be great thank you i just had to do this what were the reasons you needed to be reinstated mine were for dropping too many classes its not necessarily a bad things though you may have to provide a statement and bring in a transcript i needed to provide letters from professors showing my progress and i even brought in a doctors note i met with a financial aid committe and went into detail on why i dropped so many classes and what was going on in my life at the time i explained to them that i needed finanical aid once i was granted aid for the year i was put on probabtion which meant i have to complete of all attempted courses or else i would have to petition again i think your petition depends on reasons why you need to do this dropping courses reaching too many credit hours or gpa be as honest as possible and when you set up an appointment to meet with the committe show them that you will make sure it wont happen again i hope this helps Graduate school Contract Grade (education) Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Law school Appeal Terri Schiavo Juris Doctor Downing Street memo Government of India Act 1935 National Kidney Foundation Singapore MoveOn Scientology beliefs and practices Royal Assent Education in the United States Theory of conduct French Revolution Judicial functions of the House of Lords Intelligent design Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chiropractic Privy Council of the United Kingdom College admissions Professor Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead University of Bristol Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix United States House of Representatives Student loan Brown University Expert system Education in Hong Kong Intelligent design movement Master's degree Massachusetts Institute of Technology Schabir Shaik Trial Parliament of the United Kingdom Teach the Controversy Lord Chancellor Northern Ireland Assembly 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Opus Dei Resurrection of Jesus Israeli West Bank barrier English Civil War College Supreme Court of the United States Donald Rumsfeld Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Education in Portugal ACORN Phillips Exeter Academy Barbara Boxer The Dalek Invasion of Earth Toledo Strip Hereditary peer Simon Commission The writing of Principia Mathematica Education in Australia Government of France Glossary of graph theory Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Community college Louis XV of France Stevens Institute of Technology Norwegian Campaign Trinity College, Dublin G__del's incompleteness theorem Avenue Q Dennis Rader Extreme Programming Boy Scouts of America Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Supernatural Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds Centre Party (Germany) Gary Ackerman Thomas Paine National Certificate of Educational Achievement C plus plus A Course In Miracles Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Canadian Heraldic Authority Past teachings of Prem Rawat Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Center for Science and Culture New Hampshire Supreme Court History of the British constitution Doctor of Philosophy British monarchy The Skeptical Environmentalist University of Idaho New Zealand Parliament British honours system Medical College Calcutta
