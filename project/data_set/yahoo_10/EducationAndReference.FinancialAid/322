what the worst that can happen financial aid i took a federal loan years ago for college under my parent name because i was not eligible to take it under my name when i took the loan the financial aid office told me that if my mom is not able to pay back the loan i will be transferred to my name i did not have a problem with that b c my mom is really old yrs it was all fine untill six month ago that the loan people start calling i called them back and tell them that my mom is not working now i will pay the loan back when i graduate but they are forcing me to make a payment plan now treatning me that if this loan is not paid for they are going to take a federal action against my mom i have two little brother in th grade the other in th grade they might need financial aid later if they decide to go to college what the worst that can happen if payment plan is not made now i will be graduating spring next year and plan to pay this loan back what the worst that can happen this loan is uder my moms name the loan people are actually treatning her to make payment she wanted me to talk to the loan people the question is what the worst that could happen to her if i decide not to make a payment plan now this could negatively affect your credit and any current and future financial aid i would first go to your school's financial aid office and talk with them and see if they can do anything from their side so you can get it deferred but depending on the type of loan it is that may not be a possibility if that doesn't work try talking with the company organization directly that the loan is through and explain the situation to them and see if they can work something out with you in regards to deferment or smaller payments until you graduate whatever you do do not decide to just not worry about it until you graduate because by then it could be too late to fix or take too long to fix the damage that may be caused by not paying on it Student loan Bond Mortgage 401(k) Life insurance Deflation (economics) Citigroup Debt Insurance Annuity Credit score Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in the United States Money Derivative (finance) Government debt Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Education in the People's Republic of China Bretton Woods system Short selling Interest Islamic banking Asian financial crisis 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Freeters Health insurance Gold standard Government National Mortgage Association Marshall Plan Graduate school Donald Trump Taxation in the United States Treaty of Versailles Martin J.
