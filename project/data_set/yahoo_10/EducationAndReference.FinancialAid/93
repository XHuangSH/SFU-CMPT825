are private student loans a viable supplement to federal loans and scholarships i see alot of private student loan companies being advertised on tv these days i was wondering if these companies are legit and if this is a good idea for supplement funding when federal loans and scholarships don't cover everything first always make sure to exhaust scholarship and grant options first secondly i would not get involved with the companies that send you unsolicited offers in the mail the ones that are legit you will recognize because they will probably be through a well known and reputable bank or financial institution most programs that administer federal loans like sallie mae also have a private loan division this is good because when it is time for repayment you can get the same grace period for your federal loan that you receive with your federal loans and consolidation will also be easier i recommend going to sallie mae's website www salliemae com or contacting one of their customer service representatives with any questions your school's financial aid office is also an excellent source of information or your guidance counselor if you are still in high school good luck Student loan Scholarship Education in the United States Bank Mortgage Citigroup Financial aid Education in the People's Republic of China Bond Soci__t__ G__n__rale No Child Left Behind Act Islamic banking Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Financial services E-mail spam Tertiary education fees in Australia Debt consolidation Security (finance) Savings and loan association Education in New Zealand Ross School of Business Marshall Plan College admissions GED Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology Credit card Finance Advance fee fraud Bretton Woods system Spam (electronic) Graduate school Ivy League Tuition Students' union University of Rochester Unemployment benefit University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Primerica Financial Services Federal Reserve University of Toronto Enron Corporation Education in Japan Debt World Bank Group Toronto-Dominion Bank Investment bank Dalhousie Student Union Education in Germany Wells Fargo Short selling Independent agencies of the United States government University of Pretoria Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Monetary policy History of the United States (1918-1945) Money supply Pharmaceutical company Corporation Cable television Internet fraud Canadian National Railway 401(k) The Standard British universities Small business Price discrimination College Mergers and acquisitions University of Virginia Culture of the United States Interest Education in Malaysia Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Independent school (UK) Elections in the United States Grameen Bank America Online Annuity Probation officer Legal aid Life insurance School choice European Union Fulbright Program Economy of Russia Stock Duke University Charter school Monetary and fiscal policy of Japan
