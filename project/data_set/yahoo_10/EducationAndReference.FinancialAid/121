moving to tampa i want to move to tampa florida i currently live about hours away from tampa so it's not going to be such a huge change i just need some advice on how to go about doing it i'm so obviously i don't have much money i'm in college so most of my money goes to tuition and stuff i know i can get student loans and things like that but what about the apartment and living expenses i don't want to live in campus by the way i'm planning on getting a part time job but i don't think that will be able to pay for everything i will also be living with someone else so my rent won't be so much do you know any nice areas in tampa preferably close to the airport where i will work and close to fsu the college i want to attend any other advice about moving out for the first time student loans are intended to help pay all the costs of attending college not just the tuition when you apply for aid fill out the fafsa online and have the information sent to fsu they should tell you exactly what types of aid and how much you're eligible for consider all of your options you may be able to live more cheaply off campus but you may get more financial aid if you're on campus as far as moving advice save as much as possible before you move even if its only a little it'll help if you have more stuff to move than you can fit in the car consider greyhound you do more work you have to take it to a terminal and go get it on the other end but its cheaper than mail or ups look around your room and think about the things that you are used to having and won't be able to take with you those are the things you will need however talk to your roommate before you buy things so that you don't waste your money this includes shipping things to tampa if you don't need it don't pay to get in there if you change your mind later you can go get it or have somebody send it and you'll know you really needed it managing your money when you're on your own for the first time can be tough write everything down and think long term if you get loan money that's supposed to help pay your living expenses for the semester keep track of how much those bills are going to be so that you'll have enough to pay them this is especially important if you're trying to go to school and work since if you have to pick up extra hours because you didn't manage your money well it could cut down on the time you have for studying sounds like you're already thinking ahead so just keep doing that good luck Student loan Education in Germany Florida State University Education in the People's Republic of China Tuition Education in the United States Graduate school Mutual fund University of Central Florida Financial aid College admissions Credit card Life insurance Internet fraud Mortgage Microeconomics Economics Gross domestic product University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign The Apprentice 2 Poker jargon Personal finance Price discrimination Florida International University Stock Seneca College Unemployment benefit Leeds United F.C.
