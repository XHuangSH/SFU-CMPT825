should i take out a student loan i'm getting ready to start college as a freshman and i was kind of thinking about taking out a student loan to get a new car do you think that's a bad idea the car i have now is a chevy metro and there's nothing wrong with it i just don't feel safe driving it since it's so small and i will be driving on the highway to get to college so my question is do you think it's a good bad idea to take out a student loan since you don't have to start paying it off until you graduate college or should i just keep my car and save me money well you cant take out a student loan to buy personal items that do not have a thing to do with school student loans are for paying for the costs of classes books room and board but you should save your money to pay for school then you should buy a car when you get out of college education is the sucess for the future and dont make money a factor because you have all your life to pay back school its a simple and the best investement a person can make if you car is working fine you dont need one a car gets you from point a to point b and if your car does this you dont need a new one Student loan Education in Germany Education in the United States Insurance Capital accumulation Annuity Graduate school Short selling Anarchism and capitalism Avenue Q Personal finance Corporation Stock Capitalism GED Singlish Education in the People's Republic of China Life insurance Hillary Rodham Clinton Arbitrage Primerica Financial Services Bond Islamic banking Inflation One Tree Hill (TV series) 401(k) Saved by the Bell Tuition Citigroup Theory of conduct Mothers Against Drunk Driving Usury Education reform The New School at West Heath Debt Interest Warren Buffett Law of value Money Mortgage Supply and demand University of Massachusetts Amherst Current teachings of Prem Rawat Surplus value Driver's license Textbook Student Public transport Great Teacher Onizuka Predatory lending German grammar Gross domestic product Virginia Military Institute Hyperinflation Education The College of New Jersey Sam Walton Health insurance Productive and unproductive labour College admissions Princeton University Vanderbilt University Financial markets Grandview, U.S.A.
