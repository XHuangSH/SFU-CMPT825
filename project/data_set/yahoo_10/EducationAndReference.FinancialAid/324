my husband and i have poor credit we own a house and we make about a month can we get a loan we just got behind and now we can't catch up i think that you should visit a debt consolidator it sounds like a loan would only add to your troubles in the meantime you should eliminate all expenses you don't absolutely have to have ie cable television entertainment such as eating out and watching movies at theatres curb your food preferences and eat more simply a few times a week its amazing how focusing on tailoring your expenses can really work in your favor so that you can more quickly pay off your bills figure out what you can live without and then give it the ax at least for now if you have a really high car payment consider selling it and getting something real econimical until you are in a better position to pay high monthly payments for a car if you have kids its a good time to teach them about living within their means and looking at their spending habits turn down your air conditioner and summer and your heater in the winter and turn off lights when they are not being used all year long every little bit adds up if you can cut a month and that's less than of what you bring in less than a day from your monthly budget by prioritizing and cutting down on unnecesary expenses you will have saved a year this should go a long ways toward paying your bills and hopefully helping you catch up the thing about loans is that you will be paying interest on it that probably isn't what you really want especially if you are now paying interest on your credit cards it just doesn't make good financial sense Mortgage Credit card Gross domestic product Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hyperinflation Personal finance FairTax Economy of Russia Money Student loan The Amazing Race Debt Deflation (economics) Interest Insurance Bond Economy of the United States Annuity Credit score United Kingdom corporation tax Primerica Financial Services Government debt History of the United States (1918-1945) Capital accumulation Life insurance Great Depression Internet fraud Keynesian economics Debt consolidation Microeconomics Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Inflation Animal Crossing EastEnders Short selling Social Security (United States) Government National Mortgage Association Home Box Office Gold standard Donald Trump Theory of conduct Leasing Leeds United F.C.
