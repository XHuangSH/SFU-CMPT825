help on fafsa i live with my dad but he wont give me his information or pay for my school can i put my moms info cause she will give me it but i dont live with her what else can i really do unfortunately you have to have your legal guardian's information to fill out the fafsa which i assume is your father since you said you don't live with your mom many schools will actually require both parents' information in order to make a decision even if they won't help you with payment in order to be fair to students looking for financial assistance my suggestion would be have someone talk to your father and assure him that giving the information does nothing to him but it will help you get money for school the government uses it only for that reason and nothing else otherwise you need to look for scholarships Child support Student loan Divorce Tuition Financial aid Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Insurance Fathers' rights Scholarship Bond Credit card Corporate governance RuneScape quests College admissions Tertiary education fees in Australia Free trade Graduate school Mr. and Mrs. Turner Education in the United States Adoption Mediation Establishment Clause of the First Amendment United Kingdom corporation tax Kyle Broflovski Terri Schiavo Fathers' rights movement in the UK Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Springfield Elementary School School choice Intelligence quotient Father Law School Admissions Test Transsexuality Independent school (UK) Economics Cindy Sheehan Advance fee fraud Guinevere Jones Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Affirmative action Grandview, U.S.A.
