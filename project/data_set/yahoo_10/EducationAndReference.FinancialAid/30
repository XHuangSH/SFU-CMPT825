financial aid okay so fall semester is coming i messed up last and lost financial aid for a semester not enough completed hours they said if i do good in the fall i will get it back for the spring well guess what i don't have enough money to pay for fall out of state so i'm wondering if i can't get private student loans despite losing my financial aid eligibility for the fall also if i can't enroll this fall do i have to start loan payback i plan to enroll in the spring if so i might be screwed did you appeal your financial aid suspension with an extenuating circumstance or did you just goof off last year if you just goofed off you may be out of luck and really need to pay for fall but find out if the aid office requires you to be full time if you can swing a part time semester you may be able to stay in school or you can consider transferring to a more local community college for a year and doing better there are alternative loans for students who are on suspension so if you haven't applied for one get your butt in gear if you aren't in school for fall yes you will go into repayment on your loans in november december if you were in classes till the end of the spring semester you may be able to ask the servicer about forebearance however if you really will be back in school for spring you'll have to pay the interest due but your principle will be deferred just remember if you come out of repayment on this loan you won't get a grace period again on it so if you aren't enrolled again you need to be prepared to pay immediately Student loan Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Academic term Education in Germany Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 401(k) Lend-Lease Mortgage Graduate school College admissions Islamic banking Tertiary education fees in Australia United Kingdom corporation tax Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Credit card Professor Kwantlen University College Juris Doctor Stock American University Education in Romania Princeton University Voluntary Student Unionism Bond Education in Portugal Tulane University Jeb Bush Debt Marshall Plan Dalhousie Student Union Brown University Community college Education in New Zealand University of Central Florida Money Deflation (economics) Education in Hong Kong Bretton Woods system Hyperinflation Microcredit Scholarship Cafeteria Bank Education in Australia Financial aid Annuity Walt Disney World College Program Social Security (United States) Developing countries' debt Paul Martin Virginia Military Institute Education in Taiwan Life insurance GED Gwinnett University Center Montgomery Blair High School U.S. public debt University of Houston Education in Japan University of Tennessee Hampshire College Chiropractic Bush v.
