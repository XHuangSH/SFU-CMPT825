education loan what is the best bank to borrow from i bank with chase and they seem to have a pretty good rate i've also checked out astrive both seem reasonable to me can anyone share experiences they've had with either or recommend someone better please do not give me information on scholarships and government money i need information on a loan only thanks i have school loans through sallie mae and through wachovia both have great rates and the customer service is very good as well i've heard bad things about astrive about how someone was quoted one rate and given another higher one so i would be very careful with them if you bank with chase my guess is they will be the best to get a loan from however you should shop around at every bank possible because loan rates vary a lot and you want to make sure to get the best rate possible good luck Bank Student loan Financial services Deflation (economics) Mortgage Bond Credit card Microcredit Federal National Mortgage Association Islamic banking Debt Education in the United States Money creation Monetary policy Usury Bretton Woods system Short selling Capital accumulation Money supply Savings and loan association Subsidy Wachovia Annuity Insurance Hyperinflation Money Inflation Savings and Loan crisis Economy of the United States Federal Reserve Predatory lending Central bank Bank fraud Tertiary education fees in Australia Credit union Financial markets Islamic economics Tuition Gold standard Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Interest Privatization Bank of America Primerica Financial Services Investment bank Security (finance) Debt consolidation Asian financial crisis Capitalism Education in the People's Republic of China Economy of Russia Reserve Bank of New Zealand Economy of India Password Prolog Interest rate Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Economy of Pakistan Graduate school World Bank Group Deficit spending Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Price discrimination Yield curve Small business Fiat money Great Depression Mutual fund Little Britain Euro Payday loan Government National Mortgage Association Mergers and acquisitions Economy of Chile Finance Advance fee fraud Exchange rate Luck Theory of conduct Social Credit Fractional-reserve banking Pound sterling 401(k) Cheque Charles Ponzi School of Salamanca Ross School of Business EastEnders Betting (poker) Wells Fargo Airbus Poker jargon Unemployment benefit Education in Germany British universities Top-up fees Supply-side economics Government debt Stock
