financial help unforseen circumstances have caused my family and i to move to the us we just got here so i am just starting to send in my applications for college for this fall semester i'm so glad some colleges have rolling admissions anyways i'm so worried about the cost of it all its too late to apply for financial aid for this semester is there anything i can do in order to lower the cost of the tuition we moved from singapore and that's where i've been for years but i am an american citizen if that helps my parents want me to get into an actual university as opposed to a community college though please help i'm going to get a job but what else can i do about the cost loans what else please let me know thanks since you missed the deadline for filing the fafsa federal student aid you can only go after scholarships and loans most scholarships will also have been designated at this point so you probably can only get loans for this semester my suggestion would be to put off school for a year it isn't ideal but you can't get federal loans without filing the fafsa on time and private loans have much higher interest rates if you qualify then you can also get government grants many schools also look at the fafsa to determine your financial need i didn't qualify for government assistance but my school was expensive enough that they used that form to determine my need for them if you really must start this year determine the university you are most interested in and ask them what community college courses they will accept then take those courses for a much cheaper price and transfer into a school next year Student loan Tuition Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Financial aid Graduate school Education in Germany College admissions Affirmative action Education in Hong Kong Juris Doctor Kwantlen University College Education in New Zealand Culture of the United States Community college Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United Kingdom corporation tax Scholarship Brown University Price discrimination Education in Portugal Life insurance Tertiary education fees in Australia Law school Subsidy Asian financial crisis GED Princeton University College Inflation Taxation in the United States Education in Australia University of Rochester Cornell University Academic term Grove City College Credit card Insurance Tulane University Divorce Privatization Appeal Professor 401(k) Students' union Education in Taiwan Pitzer College Middle Tennessee State University Higher education in Japan Bond Hopkins School Physician Microeconomics University of Central Florida Franklin W.
