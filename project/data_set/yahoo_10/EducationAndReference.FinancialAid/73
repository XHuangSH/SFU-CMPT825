question about being poor and paying for college i graduated high school a few years ago however decided at that time not to go to college now i am in a few months and live on my own and have a very limited income i am considering going to college once again i was wondering due to my very low income if it would be possible to have my college expenses paid for by the government or some other organizaiton or if i would have to take out loans and pay them back at a later date thanks all of my income goes towards paying my current bills student loans good luck with the debt as for what the gentlemen a few avatars below me said he must have went to school eons ago you may be able to get a pell grant which means you don't have to pay anything back but ha good luck it's nearly impossible to get one thanks to our current president yes fill out a fafsa form from your school's financial aid office but beware student loan interest rates are not low they are above right now for a government loan i couldn't imagine how high the rates are for a private loan there are types of loans subsidized and unsubsidized with one you are paying interest while you are in school with the other the government is paying it for you with all it's true you don't have to pay anything back until you've been out of school for months be very careful only take out as little as you need Financial aid Credit card Tuition Subsidy Gross domestic product Debt College admissions United Kingdom corporation tax Education in the United States Economy of Pakistan FairTax Education in New Zealand Mortgage Money Students' union Federal Reserve Interest Government debt Economy of the United States Hyperinflation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Short selling Monetary policy Publicly funded medicine Top-up fees History of the United States (1918-1945) Annuity Microcredit Debt consolidation Economy of Russia Barbara Boxer Real estate bubble Inflation 401(k) Unemployment Corporation Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Princeton University Security (finance) Municipal bond Tertiary education fees in Australia Islamic banking Bretton Woods system Gold standard U.S. public debt Capitalism Lend-Lease Education in Japan Insurance Tax Bank of England Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Tennessee State Constitution Health insurance Price discrimination Life insurance Economy of Cuba Deficit spending Social Security (United States) Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Cornell University Education in Germany Economy of Nigeria Deflation (economics) Debt levels and flows Interest rate Economy of Haiti Evan Mecham Sam Walton Corporate finance Personal finance Health care in the United States Taxation in the United States University of Rochester Bank Hillary Rodham Clinton GED Member of the European Parliament Economy of El Salvador Usury Capital accumulation Georgetown University Financial markets Economy of Mexico Deficit Springfield, Massachusetts Graduate school Money supply Higher Education Bill Small business Treasury security Economy of Chile Developing countries' debt Economy of India School of Salamanca British House of Commons
