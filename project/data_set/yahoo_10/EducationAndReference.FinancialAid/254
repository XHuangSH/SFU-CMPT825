money for college ok my wife and i want to take online classes but are concerned about money we dont really have each for the classes where can i get some financial aid i dont make that much money i know about federal pell grant but dont know how to apply for it anyone got a good website or two to help out thank you ok how old are you but you can go to college foundation of state you live in like i can go to collegefoundation of south carolina or if you want to take a loan out google astrive student loans you get your money in less than a week but as far as grants and loans go you should really check with the school you need to go online and fill out a fafsa form its for financial aid and you can just google fafsa its a form and they send it to the school that you are going to apply to and the financial aid department there will see if you are up for any grants and grants are good you dont have to pay them back i got over this year in grants and the loan from astrive loans are good to bc you dont have to pay it back until after you graduate and they have low monthly payments and interest rates but if you get a federal loan from the fafsa paperwork the goverment will pay the montly interest rates so that you dont have to but i think depending on when you want to apply fafsa might be to late since i had to file mine before march since i was enrolling this fall so you need to call the school taht you are looking to get into to see if they will take it hope this helps Student loan Financial aid College admissions Tuition Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Mortgage Deflation (economics) Bond Columbia University Life insurance Interest rate Money Subsidy Economy of the United States Marshall Plan 401(k) Islamic banking Interest Internet fraud Graduate school Government debt Unemployment benefit Dalhousie Student Union Education in Germany FairTax Primerica Financial Services United States Postal Service Monetary policy Princeton University Education in New Zealand Finance Tertiary education fees in Australia Gold standard Cornell University Credit union Social Security (United States) Federal Reserve Savings and loan association Taxation in the United States Scholarship Government National Mortgage Association Money supply Inflation United Kingdom corporation tax Flat tax College and university rankings Annual percentage rate Microcredit Corporation Economics Bank Bretton Woods system Article One of the United States Constitution Babson College Debt Security (finance) Professor Islamic economics Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Education in Japan Affirmative action Vanderbilt University Economy of Russia Bank fraud University of Central Florida Predatory lending Barack Obama Insurance Short selling University of Maryland, College Park Divorce Value added tax Queen's University Financial markets University of Tennessee Tax Money creation Housing cooperative Economy of the Philippines Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Students' union Unemployment Education in England Franklin W.
