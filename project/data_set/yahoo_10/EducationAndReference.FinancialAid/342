help with federal stafford loan i recieved my master promisory note in the mail today and i have a few questions about filling it out first why do i have to have two adult references listing my parents makes sense but will they contact the other person i write down as a reference and do they have any obligations as my reference and second if i choose a lender does that mean i automatically get the loan or do i have to contact the bank and apply for a stafford loan there please help i'm a first generation college student and i am so confused the references are not cosigners so they would have no obligation of repayment if you were to default on your loans i'm not sure if mine were ever called or not when you choose a lender you are only stating which bank you would like to get your money from you do not have to ever contact the bank regarding the loan when i was in school i chose tcf bank since i was a customer of theirs already and graduated yrs ago my loans have since went into repayment and i still have yet to contact them my loans are going through salliemae for payment even though my lender was tcf if you have any questions send me an email and i can go over more with you Student loan Mortgage Bank Debt Interest Credit card Government debt Predatory lending Finance Usury Real estate broker Education in the United States Deflation (economics) Article One of the United States Constitution Islamic banking Bank of China (Hong Kong) Money Unemployment benefit Credit score Short selling Interest rate Monetary policy Government National Mortgage Association Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Repurchase agreement Insurance Annuity Central bank Tertiary education fees in Australia Advance fee fraud 401(k) Financial aid Security (finance) Developing countries' debt Great Depression Corporation Citigroup Islamic economics Annual percentage rate Financial markets Savings and Loan crisis Bank fraud E-mail United Kingdom corporation tax Contract Federal National Mortgage Association Education in the People's Republic of China Economy of the United States Education in Germany Lender of last resort Debt consolidation Microcredit Donald Trump United States v.
