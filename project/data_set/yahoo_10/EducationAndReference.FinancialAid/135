can i pay back my student loans without interest so me and this guy at work both owe more than in student loans and we both dropped out of school i've been paying mine i have them consolidated so i have a lot of interest and i'll be paying them for a long time but he says he's not gonna pay his until the lenders hand the loan to the government and then he'll be forced to pay them back but he says the government won't charge interest they'll just ruin his credit for awhile so basically he's saying that i could just refuse to pay back my loans until the government gets a hold of them and then i don't have to worry about any interest the only consequence being my ruined credit and i don't plan on buying a house or new car anytime in the near future so that doesn't bother me is this guy out of his mind or is this the perfect scheme the reason it's called ruining your credit is because it lasts forever if you are in a difficult situation you can plead with sallie mae they can defer 'principle' payments for a while you'll just be paying interest but the debt will not be decreasing i cannot believe that the govt will not try to recoup all of their loast interest they certainly do it with taxes according to their website the consequences of default are severe the entire loan balance principal and interest can be immediately due and payable you ll lose your deferment options you won t be eligible for additional federal student aid your account might be turned over to a collection agency if so you ll have to pay additional interest charges late fees collection costs and possibly court costs and attorney fees these costs will really add up and it will take you even longer to pay off your student loan as mentioned earlier your account will be reported to national credit bureaus and your credit rating can be damaged you might find it very difficult to receive other types of credit such as credit cards car loans or mortgages because many landlords do credit checks it might be hard to rent an apartment some employers check to see if you re responsible by looking at your credit rating so bad credit could even affect getting a job on top of this your default will remain on your credit report for up to seven years your federal income tax refunds and in some states your state income tax refunds might be withheld and applied toward your loan repayment this happens a lot to defaulters and it can really hurt if you were counting on that refund your employer at the request of the loan holder may withhold garnish part of your wages you might be unable to obtain a professional license in some states Annuity Insurance Deflation (economics) Debt FairTax Life insurance 401(k) Microeconomics Interest United Kingdom corporation tax Islamic banking Money Bank Unemployment benefit Child support Tax Economy of the United States Education in the United States Mutual fund Personal finance Flat tax Credit score Government National Mortgage Association Inflation Derivative (finance) U.S. public debt Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Citigroup History of the United States (1918-1945) Primerica Financial Services Tertiary education fees in Australia Federal National Mortgage Association Compensation of employees Subsidy Plame affair Unemployment Publicly funded medicine Debt consolidation Economy of Russia Great Depression Income tax Gold standard Leasing Payroll Tennessee State Constitution Bretton Woods system Schabir Shaik Trial Bank fraud Short selling Health insurance Mortgage-backed security Value added tax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Pension Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 United States Postal Service Conscription Credit repair Capitalism Money supply George W.
