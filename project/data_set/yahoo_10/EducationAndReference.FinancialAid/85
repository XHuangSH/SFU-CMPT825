is college going to make me poor ok i have been obsessing with this question in my head for the past few months i left a a year it job at to go back to college and get a business degree in finance and hopefully a cfa certification then go on to invest peoples money i really did not want to go back to school but family pressured me into it it seems like school is sucking all my money away i saved up k now where i am at i have left now i have and a half years of school left each year costs about k a year i do not qualify for anything except loans from the government my car is about ready to die and have to leave my part time job to go back to school this fall not having stably income is really getting to me i had to get on anti depressants after i went back i think mainly because of the financial pressures of having to pay for my own school i want to be able to be conformable after i graduate and be able to afford to move out on my own if you where in this situation what would you d you seem to be doing better than most most kids who go off to college have nothing to start off with it's great that you will only have a couple years of loans i know it must be weird leaving your good job but think of it this way a college degree will matter in the future it's a great asset to have i know it's easy to say i don't need it now but someday if you don't have that job you might have a really hard time finding a job that pays as well as this one you are young and fresh and with it right now so you are marketable your family is just concerned about your future however you are lucky you have been able to get through college this far without having to rely souly on loans Deflation (economics) Great Depression Bond Capitalism Personal finance Education in the People's Republic of China Economy of Russia Graduate school Economy of Africa Economy of the United States Life insurance Interest Debt Tuition Hyperinflation Gold standard Avenue Q Corporation Bank Finance Credit card Unemployment Annuity Privatization Inflation Unemployment benefit Social Security (United States) FairTax Capital accumulation Microcredit Bretton Woods system Derivative (finance) Keynesian economics Mortgage Security (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Money supply History of the United States (1918-1945) Social Credit Warren Buffett Outsourcing Islamic banking Financial markets Yield curve Freeters Financial analyst Money Small business Wal-Mart Citigroup Mutual fund New Deal Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Insurance Stock Government debt Great Depression in the United Kingdom Economic inequality Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Supply-side economics Leeds United F.C.
