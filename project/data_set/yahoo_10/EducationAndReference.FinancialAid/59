financial aid question work study and scholarships i'm doing work study this fall and spring but i expect for my bill to paid in full through scholarships what happens to the work study money will it just be credited for next semester will i be getting paid by check every two weeks or will i not be eligible for work study anymore b c my bill is paid in full i already talked to my financial aid advisor but she was very unclear so i'd appreciate some answers on here thanks these are outside scholarships i'm not sure if it varies from school to school but at my school when a student receives an outside scholarship they reduce the loans first and then work study the money that we earn from work study is not used to pay off tuition but it's spending money travel books etc say the school said that the total expenses for the year was from fafsa and css they say that my total need was instead of just giving it to me or taking out a loan i will earn that money by working if i then receive an outside scholarship of then they reduce the amount of money that i have to make from working to and i will get the scholarship money instead of working for it if with your scholarships you receive all that the school says that you need you will no longer be eligible for federal work study but some schools do allow for students not on financial aid to have jobs on campus just that it is all taxed what i earn from work study is not taxed as long as i don't exceed the amount that i am supposed to make in a year semester if i do i would then exceed my need amount if i do exceed it i am just taxed for it if i go over what i demonstrate as need i am only taxed on those once again i'm not sure if it works the same at all colleges and universities Graduate school Education in the United States Credit card Education in the People's Republic of China Social Security (United States) Financial aid Tuition Education in Germany Kwantlen University College Scholarship Tertiary education fees in Australia Bond Insurance Students' union FairTax Tax Life insurance Taxation in the United States Inflation Money SAT United Kingdom corporation tax Minimum wage Academic term Law school Hyperinflation Member of the European Parliament Quizbowl Microeconomics Salary cap University of Rochester Annuity Social Security debate (United States) Affirmative action Flat tax Brown University PE ratio School choice Deflation (economics) Professor Capitalism Community college Juris Doctor Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health insurance Princeton University Lawyer Primerica Financial Services Financial endowment Government debt Hopkins School Inheritance tax Cheque Tax resistance Education in Romania British House of Commons American University Earned income tax credit Grove City College Corporation Franklin W.
