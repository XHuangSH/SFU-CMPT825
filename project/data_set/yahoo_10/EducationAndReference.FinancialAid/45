where can we find money for college i'm trying to help my friend get money for college we've tried loans my friend is getting some financial aid but not much at all not even of a semesters worth total income is under and we cant find anything to help us what should we do where can we find the money most important is how he filed his fafsa is he an independent student meaning he claims himself and his parents dont it sounds like that may be the case because of his income and he than qualifies for sub and unsubsidized federal perkin loans if he is a freshman it's really tough getting money the first two years you have to go plop yourself down in the fin aid office and make them find money options for you in seeking financial aid being a pain in the ass and persistence is not only a virtue it's the only way you get anywhere every college has loans for guys like your friends you have to apply early enough to get the money they have alloted also try finaid com i believe that's the site you can get to it from fafsa try all his families affiliations they have scholarships for every ethnic and union member it requires an essay but you just might get it if your friend is still be claimed by his parents then things they have to apply for a plus loan and if they are denied due to their financial obligations he will then qualify for both the sub and unsub federal loans if he was claimed by them for this year get him to become and independent student based on his earnings and the fact that he will not be living wit his parents he must not reside with them for one whole year so that means when school is out he needs another address to put down for the rest of the year maybe go to summer school i wish i could help more i know how hard it is i got daughters through college and it was pulling teeth to get money for them other sources of income for him he can give plasma it varies from state to state but he can make about a month whatever he does do not let him do the credit card fiasco he will never get out of debt and they want monthly payments immediately so he will have to pay while in school good luck ps work study which is given by the school and is nontaxable and part time job Education in the United States Financial aid Education in Germany Graduate school Monetary policy Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bond Tuition Unemployment benefit 401(k) Interest Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Personal finance Scholarship Debt Taxation in the United States Life insurance Mortgage Credit union Unemployment Divorce Princeton University Tax Law school College Social Security (United States) Economy of Russia Article One of the United States Constitution Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Hyperinflation Affirmative action Education in Romania Money supply Tertiary education fees in Australia Bank fraud Credit score FairTax Insurance Bretton Woods system Marshall Plan Deflation (economics) Capitalism Gold standard Students' union Schabir Shaik Trial Internet fraud Economy of El Salvador Finance National Insurance U.S. public debt Security (finance) Capital accumulation GED Microeconomics Economy of the United States Great Depression Barrister No Child Left Behind Act Culture of the United States Brown University Primerica Financial Services Food Stamp Program Undergrads Child support George W.
