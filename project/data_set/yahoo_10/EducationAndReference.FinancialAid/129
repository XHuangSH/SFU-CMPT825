is there any benefit to not consolidating student loans i graduated from college two years ago and never consolidated my student loans i believed possibly wrongly that consolidating was only important if i wanted to lower my monthly rates but it wouldn't have made a difference in the total cost of my student loan my plan was to pay off large chunks of the loan and to have it paid off quickly would consolidating have made a difference in my loans and will it make a difference now even though i've been paying the loans back for two years already there's a lot of hype out there about consolidation most of it from companies anxious to get hold of your loan volume the fact is consolidation isn't the right option for every student particularly if they're not having trouble meeting their monthly payment as you seem to be doing best thing to do is call your lender have them run your numbers and see if there is a benefit to you by consolidating rates have increased since you graduated so you may actually be better off if you don't consolidate most lenders can also include your separate loans on one bill so if that would make things easier for you you can ask them about that as well bottom line you're doing a smart thing by paying off more than the minimum monthly payment this will help you pay less interest over the life of your loan and set you on the way to financial health Student loan Mortgage Bond Debt Credit card United Kingdom corporation tax Interest Life insurance Bank Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Annuity Government debt Annual percentage rate Redundant array of independent disks Subsidy Government National Mortgage Association 401(k) Primerica Financial Services Education in the United States Credit score Finance Capitalism Social Security (United States) Education in the People's Republic of China Unemployment Security (finance) FairTax Interest rate Health insurance Economy of India Unemployment benefit Privatization Financial markets Gross domestic product Predatory lending Variable universal life insurance Graduate school Gold standard Central bank Tertiary education fees in Australia Personal finance Anarchism and capitalism Credit rating agency Compensation of employees Economy of Russia History of post-Soviet Russia Corporation History of the United States (1918-1945) Flat tax Bretton Woods system Hillary Rodham Clinton Corporate finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Donald Trump Short selling Economy of Argentina Payday loan Pension Free trade Usury Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Social Security debate (United States) Refinancing Derivative (finance) Citigroup Publicly funded medicine Microeconomics Taxation in the United States Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Universal life insurance Economy of the United States Hyperinflation Economy of El Salvador Affirmative action Islamic economics Federal National Mortgage Association Mutual fund Health care in the United States Economy of Nigeria Mortgage-backed security Divorce Call centre Money Cable television Savings and loan association Inflation Lehman Brothers Microcredit Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Barbara Boxer Financial services
