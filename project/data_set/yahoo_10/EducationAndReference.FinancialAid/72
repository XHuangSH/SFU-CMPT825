are there any grants to help a high school senior pay for a laptop computer to use in college i am going to graduate soon and i was just wondering if there were any grants out there that would help me pay for some of the things i will need for college i e laptop computer do you know which school you are going to try asking the college for instance i go to iowa and their financial aid office will give out a loan specifically for a computer but they also are willing to pay for a small part of it as well as having the government pay for it i know some people that did that at my school and they said they ended up only having to back back a little less than half the loan the loan was for the entire cost of the computer but also try scholarships and simply asking big computer companies or applications such as microsoft you would be surprised at how generous some huge companies will be if you simply ask Student loan Laptop Education in the United States Financial aid Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Tuition Computer Scholarship GED Personal computer Credit card Debt Universal Serial Bus Students' union Quizbowl College admissions Public domain Franklin W.
