will this factor into my expected family contribution efc for college financial aid i'm in a dramatic situation basically between a rock and a hard place last feb my uncle passed away leaving my mother in stocks for retirement my mom cashed in the to put a down payment on a home i'm a sophomore in college and my tuition is yr i got a lot of merit aid on top of need aid and some big scholarships but will this k be factored into my mom's overall income next year she's a single mother making yr my dad doesn't pay child support i have no idea what to do if it is counted toward my efc then do i loose my federal aid that's about half of my aid and a lot of the reason a smart poor kid like me can go to college is because of student loans and grants please help if your mom no longer has the money then she doesn't have an asset that must be reported on the fafsa the fafsa asks for the value of assets today however selling the assets described may have generated capital gains that may show up on her tax return if you are selected for verification she may be asked for a statement of the value of the assets generating capital gains interest she would simply write a letter stating that while she received a sizeable asset she sold it and no longer has it showing proof of the sale and that the proceeds were used to purchase a home will prove that she doesn't have an asset she needs to report on the fafsa so the answer to your question is no the inheritance should not impact your efc Financial aid Life insurance Mutual fund Tuition Annuity Deflation (economics) Mortgage Personal finance Education in the United States Capital accumulation Microeconomics Student loan FairTax Taxation in the United States Gold standard Surplus value 401(k) Economy of Russia Corporation Social Security (United States) Derivative (finance) Gross domestic product Security (finance) SCO-Linux controversies Citigroup 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Hyperinflation Monetary policy Supply-side economics Insurance Productive and unproductive labour Mergers and acquisitions College admissions Economy of Pakistan Money supply Temasek Holdings Income trust Bretton Woods system Depreciation Inheritance tax PE ratio Rational pricing Corporate finance Privatization Evan Mecham Government debt Economy of India Inflation Wealth Money Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Arthur Laffer SAT Wal-Mart Income statement GED Debt Modern portfolio theory Robert Kiyosaki Stock Flat tax Collateralized debt obligation Capital gains tax Keynesian economics Capitalism Schabir Shaik Trial Measures of national income and output Bank Islamic banking Fractional-reserve banking Capital asset pricing model Graduate school Bank fraud Social Security debate (United States) Health insurance Canadian and American economies compared Article One of the United States Constitution Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Great Depression Politics of Canada Dividend Ponzi scheme Municipal bond Scholarship Education in the People's Republic of China Accounting methods Education in England Tax protester
