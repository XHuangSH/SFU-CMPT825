would it be wise if i save my financial aid refund checks for fall spring save them for summer session so i won't have to take out loans for summer that sounds like a good idea i know you don't want to finish school and have a lot of debt however you are not getting much income now and i know you said you really ran short a couple of months you need to keep enough money to pay the co pay on any medications you need and you need to keep enough food in your house so that you will not become anemic again it might be nice to save that money as a little nest egg in case of an emergency after all what if you get hurt and need to take cabs places instead of walking you will need a little extra money i hope nothing happens to you but we have to expect the worst in order to prepare Money FairTax Keynesian economics Student loan Hyperinflation Economy of Africa Deflation (economics) Personal finance Bond Poker jargon Debt Credit card Marshall Plan Inflation Short selling Mortgage Leeds United F.C.
