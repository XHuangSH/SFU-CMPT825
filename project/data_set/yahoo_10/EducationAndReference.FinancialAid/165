is it too late to get into college this spring hello i was looking at the fafsa website and it seems it's too late for me to get financial aid for the spring semester does this mean i can pretty much forget about going to school this spring i've never been to college before so i'm clueless about this process are there any other steps i should have already completed i know it probably depends on the college but in general thanks the deadline for fafsa is the preferred date to get your application in this is to be sure you get the most money in grants you can they do save some of the federal grant money for students who begin classes in the spring but the pot is a lot more empty than full you should apply for fafsa and may very well get a grant to assist with your schooling if you qualify you need to apply also if you were interested in taking out loans to help pay for school by completing the fafsa application you will then be eligible for federal stafford loans these are the best loans you can get to pay for school as they usually have the lowest interest rate and if you were to get unsubsidized stafford the government pays the interest while youre in school saving you some money go to http fafsa ed gov to complete your application for federal aid as for other steps to complete if you havent already apply to your school now within the next week that way you have enough time to get everything ready to attend in the spring then talk with the school you are going to attend to see what else they need you to do you will likely have to complete some additional paperwork at your college to finish the financial aid process Student loan Financial aid College admissions Tuition Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Education in Germany Education in the United States Juris Doctor Credit card Walt Disney World College Program Annuity Taxation in the United States 401(k) Mortgage Academic term Life insurance GED Physician Education in Portugal Unemployment benefit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Princeton University Money Money supply Deflation (economics) Affirmative action Professor Keynesian economics Education in Romania Tulane University Education in Japan Grove City College Kwantlen University College College and university rankings Social Security (United States) Law school 2003 California recall Dalhousie Student Union Corporation Brown University United Kingdom corporation tax Capitalism Tertiary education fees in Australia Students' union British nationality law Interest rate Credit union Federal Reserve Islamic banking Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Savings and loan association College Minor league baseball Virginia Military Institute Microeconomics Monetary policy Legal aid Bond Georgetown University Charles Ponzi Economy of Pakistan Inflation Food Stamp Program Savings and Loan crisis Education in Australia Financial markets Public education Betting (poker) Primerica Financial Services United States Postal Service Economics Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology No Child Left Behind Act School accreditation Interest Capital accumulation Economy of Russia Subsidy United States Air Force Academy Undergrads Immigration to the United States Government debt Patent Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Barrister U.S. public debt Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Marshall Plan Community college Bologna process University of Central Florida Driver's license Barbara Boxer Enlargement of the European Union Economy of the United States Gold standard Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bretton Woods system
