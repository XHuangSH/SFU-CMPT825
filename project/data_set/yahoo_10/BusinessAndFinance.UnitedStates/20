what exactly is unearned income i was recently injured at work i have just now started to receive my workers comp checks last night my boyfriend mentioned something about unearned income on my taxes something about the money i would have earned if i was not injured i am confused i know that generally it means interst from accounts and stuff like that but is there some credit or something for my situation i really dont think so but would like to get another opinion unearned income is income received without providing personal labor or services on your part such things as dividends interest rents royalties capital gains etc are all examples of unearned income workers compensation payments could be classified as unearned income but more importantly it is non taxable income you won't pay any income taxes on the wc payments so any classification of them as unearned income is a moot point under the law it's neither earned income nor unearned income but non taxable income where it would impact some taxpayers is when it comes to calculating the earned income credit any amounts received under a state wc plan would not count as earned income for the eic calculation on the other hand it would not count as unearned income which can disqualify you from the eic entirely if it's high enough or as part of your adjusted gross income which again can disqualify you from the eic if it's high enough if you are collecting wc payments there is no imputed income based upon what you might have earned had you not been injured your payments are fully tax free see irs pub page Taxation in the United States Tax United Kingdom corporation tax Flat tax FairTax Social Security (United States) Income tax Dividend Gross domestic product Measures of national income and output Dividend imputation Microeconomics 401(k) Surplus value Insurance Compensation of employees Annuity Income trust Mutual fund Life insurance Productive and unproductive labour Tax avoidance/evasion Unemployment benefit Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security debate (United States) Personal finance Inheritance tax Bond Municipal bond Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Wealth condensation Capital gains tax Double taxation Tax protester Economic inequality Anarchism and capitalism U.S. Internal Revenue Service Operating surplus Consumer price index Credit card Value added Minimum wage Workers' compensation Derivative (finance) Pension Income Article One of the United States Constitution Intermediate consumption Variable universal life insurance Economy of the United States Inflation Earned income tax credit Anarchist economics Capital accumulation United States Postal Service Tom DeLay Tax deduction Individual Savings Account Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Economy of Russia Property tax Corporation Student loan Health insurance Value added tax Jizya Mortgage Labour (economics) Taxation in Canada Payroll Tax cut Deflation (economics) Income statement Corporate finance Tertiary education fees in Australia Reaganomics Child support National Insurance Usury Keynesian economics Value product Government debt Debt Bretton Woods system Money Social Credit Tariff Self-employment Economic rent Profit Cost of capital PE ratio
