help with tax audit accountants i was recently audited i work for a railroad and am required to have a phone so i claimed it as an employee business expense it was disallowed in the audit i was allowed to deduct my cell phone but not the home line in addition i keep a vehicle at my away from home terminal to use when i eat it is not required but the company does not provide a way to get meals at the away fromhome terminal the vehicle mileage log i keep was also disallowed other employees have been audited and were allowed the exact same deductions there seems to be no consistency in the field auditors are these deductions valid in my case or is the auditor correct at first blush i'd say that the auditor was correct a home phone line is virtually never deductible as you're virtually certain to have one for personal use anyway any long distance charges on it related to work would be deductible however meal runs are personal use so that usage would not be allowable if you made runs for your employer say for parts or to transport yourself or other employees to other job sites that would be deductible the use has to be required by your employer and for his benefit for the expense to be deductible since you weren't present at the other audits you have no way of knowing what was allowed on them or how the other folks presented the expenses and tied them to an employer requirement Insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Child support Halliburton Self-employment Taxicab Tax Accountancy 401(k) Hybrid vehicle Annuity Health insurance Financial audit Scientology Life insurance Public transport Information technology audit Social Security (United States) Corporate governance PricewaterhouseCoopers Sport utility vehicle Auto insurance Food Stamp Program HIPAA FairTax Board of directors 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Compensation of employees Sarbanes-Oxley Act Tax deduction Microeconomics Enterprise content management Credit card Scientology beliefs and practices Transport in Hong Kong Expert system Logic Payroll Enron Corporation Financial statements Outsourcing Health savings account IP Multimedia Subsystem Domestic partnerships in California Indian Railways American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Rail transport United States Postal Service Database management system London Underground Interstate Highway Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Employee stock option Propositional calculus Passenger car Docklands Light Railway Private branch exchange Offshoring Natural deduction Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority North American Numbering Plan National Insurance XML Telephone Password George W.
