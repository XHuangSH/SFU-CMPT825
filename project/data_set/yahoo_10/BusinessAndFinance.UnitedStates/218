income tax exemption problem when i originally interviewed for my current job i didn't mark myself as exempt on my w form i later found out i was indeed tax exempt and refiled through my job however upon recieving my paycheck today i find that my check has indeed been gutted by federal income taxes i complain to payroll only for them to tell me we will fix it for next week but there is nothing we can do about this week's check with that said is there really nothing payroll can do is the idea that they already sent the money to the government and so they truly cant adjust the income tax out of my check or do i just have a lazy bum for a payroll chief if indeed i can't work it out with my job how do i get the lost income tax money back in the fastest possible way it was which is plenty for a college student i have done payroll for over years and this is what i can tell you depending on the amount of tax withheld a company deposits the taxes weekly bimonthly or monthly with a federal depository such as the bank of america the irs has no idea of the breakdown of the money until the w s are filed by the company at the end of the year they may also report it to the state more frequently they can therefore technically adjust their payroll and give the money back they just deposit less the next period it just may be that their payroll can't handle that type of transaction since it must be done manually i do the work for a very small company and would have no problem if they can't give it back then your only recourse is to file for a refund next year there is no way to get it from the irs early since they have no record of you personally paying the money until they receive the w s Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) FairTax Tax Flat tax Inflation U.S. Internal Revenue Service Payroll Microeconomics Social Security debate (United States) United Kingdom corporation tax Progressive tax Child support United States Postal Service Credit card Wal-Mart 401(k) Annuity Bank fraud Automated Clearing House Mutual fund Minimum wage Money supply Bond Income tax Unemployment benefit Variable universal life insurance Earned income tax credit Health savings account National Insurance Tom DeLay Mortgage Student loan Tax exemption Tax protester Salary Inheritance tax Corporation Tax resistance Personal finance New Deal Money Capital gains tax Retirement plan Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Bank Federal Reserve Tax haven Outsourcing Regressive tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Russia Treasury security Octopus card Gross domestic product Capital accumulation Poker jargon Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Advance fee fraud Life insurance Tax avoidance/evasion George W.
