if every state in the us has property taxes then what few states have the lowest property taxes and why i'd like to experiment with green living which means working hard and having little or no bills so i guess what i'm really looking for is the one state in the us with a very small property tax while we're on the subject what exactly is a property tax and how is it figured thanks it's based more on city and county not state to my knowledge no state has a property tax i have a very low property tax but just up the road my property tax would be times as high different county my city doesn't have a property tax so i only pay property tax to the county however one day we will probably have a city property tax in my previous house my county tax was about and city was around if i had lived just across the street my street was the city limits then i would not have had to pay the city property tax and would have saved year and probably still had the same services but i wont' get started on that topic property tax is calculated different for each county and city here they assess your property divide that by to find out the value of the land itself and then charge you anywhere from per go to the blackbelt of alabama if you want cheap property tax but don't expect much in return for it either year on a house here that would run you about and in the next county over probably about in some ares of nj or ca i imagine it would be well over year Property tax Taxation in the United States Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gross domestic product Inheritance tax Insurance Microeconomics Counties of the United States Capital gains tax Income tax Monopoly (game) Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Unreformed House of Commons Allodial title Article One of the United States Constitution Political subdivisions of New York State Tennessee State Constitution California Proposition 13 (1978) County Education in the United States Las Vegas, Nevada Connecticut Explosive material Value added tax Inflation Mutual fund Mortgage Registered Retirement Savings Plan Public good Warren Buffett Reaganomics Economy of Russia Progressive tax Catskill State Park Economy of India Land value tax Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Salary cap Capitalism Killington, Vermont Blackjack Stamp duty Tax haven Evan Mecham Keynesian economics Personal finance Mathematics Council tax 401(k) Surplus value Eminent domain Fulton County, Georgia Entropy Gold standard Pennsylvania Supply-side economics Reedy Creek Improvement District Pacific, Missouri Regressive tax Poker jargon Doomsday argument Supply and demand Deflation (economics) PE ratio Cerritos, California Canadian Senate American individualist anarchism Labor theory of value Credit card Depreciation District Real estate bubble Australian constitutional law Social Security (United States) Bruce Johnson Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Arthur Laffer Money Domesday Book Easement Government of Maryland Ponzi scheme Greene County, Ohio Electrophysiology Expert system Texas Wall Street Miami-Dade County, Florida Tax exemption Politics of the United States Georgia (U.S. state)
