help my former boss won't pay me i was working at a small teddy bear store and was let go because the buisness is not making any money and they are going to get out of their lease i was let go weeks ago when i was working there my boss would never pay me on time and my schedule would always be given to me in the middle of the week right now i am owed over dollars and he is giving me the run around he told me he would have my money last monday that never happened then he said wednesday and that never happened then today he told me he would have it tonight at closing i come in and he is not even there i contacted him through text and calls and he is ignoring me i contacted his father who owns the buisness and he told me that i will be paid tomorrow but i am getting very concerned because i am leaving on monday to new york for two weeks my boss never filled taxes on me even though i told him repeatedly that i have my s s n and everything for him what are my options if his father does not give my money tomorrow thank you in advance tell your former boss that if you don't have your money by a certain day within a few days that you are going to call your state department of labor then if you don't get the money go ahead and make the call the better business bureau will put a report on file against him if you report him so anyone who calls and asks can hear that he has had a complaint filed but if they are getting out of their lease and going out of business that won't really mean anything bbb is more for customers to use not employees it sounds like he doesn't have the money and that's why he's not paying you i'm guessing this from what you said about getting paid late before and their not making any money and if he doesn't have it you might have to get in line with other creditors if he files bankrupcy or something and your chances might not be real good of getting your money did he withhold any taxes from your wages if he did then it's hard to tell if he sent them to the irs like he should have i hope you kept your pay stubs you'll need to talk to the irs before filing if he doesn't give you a w if he didn't deduct any you'll still need your own records to file your taxes good luck on getting your money but this doesn't sound good Wal-Mart Taxation in the United States Flat tax Wheel of Fortune Ocean's Twelve Poker jargon Tax protester FairTax 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Tom DeLay Plame affair Ken Jennings Surplus value Supply-side economics Social Security (United States) Progressive tax Animal Crossing Internet fraud Outsourcing Economy of the United States Tax EastEnders Social rule 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Paul Hackett Capital accumulation United Kingdom corporation tax Annuity Enron Corporation U.S. Internal Revenue Service Child support Microeconomics Major League Baseball television contracts Income tax 401(k) Islamic banking Citigroup Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Timeline of the Enron scandal United States Postal Service Alex Ferguson Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health insurance National Football League Neighbours Minimum wage Badly Drawn Kitties Live 8 Infidels Pitaten James T.
