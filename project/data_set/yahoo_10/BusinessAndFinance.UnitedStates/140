if i am tax exempt will my parents be able to file for me on their tax return i'm years old and want to be tax exempt but my parents still want to be able to claim me as their dependent is that possible you kind of have it backwards there are rules that if your parents meet them then they can claim you if you live with them for over half of the year and do not provide more than half of your own support for the year then they can claim you now for your income if they meet the rules to claim you whether they actually claim you of not then you can't claim yourself and take an exemption for yourself on your own tax return if you make less than for the year though you still won't owe any tax and if you do not expect to have any tax liability for the year and didn't have any last year then and only then can you claim exempt which means that no income tax will be withheld from your paycheck if you claim exempt on your w when you aren't then you'll have to pay taxes and possible penalties when you file a return at the end of the year plus a possible fine for claiming exempt when you aren't whether or not you claim exempt does not have any effect on whether your parents can claim you Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Tax Flat tax Inheritance tax Property tax Capital gains tax Social Security (United States) Tax exemption Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Insurance Tax protester Income tax Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Centrelink Student loan Tax resistance London Congestion Charge United States Postal Service Child support 401(k) British nationality law Allodial title Dividend imputation Life insurance Bankruptcy in the United States Form 1040 Article One of the United States Constitution H-1B visa Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 Education in the United States Salary cap Jizya Benny Hinn Value added tax Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Kyoto Protocol Freedom of Information Act (United States) Swedish allotment system Homestead exemption Regressive tax Corporation Income trust Tax haven First Amendment to the United States Constitution Dhimmi Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 U.S. Internal Revenue Service Tax credit Babylonian law Separation of church and state Hillary Rodham Clinton Television licence Tax avoidance/evasion Lloyd's of London Contract Progressive tax Double taxation Tax cut Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Contract with America Reparations for slavery Immigration to the United States Earned income tax credit 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Scientology Interplay Entertainment Municipal bond Constitution of Ireland Minimum wage Bankruptcy British monarchy Tai shogi Accounting methods Bulk vending Unemployment benefit Sales tax Dividend Individual Savings Account Variable universal life insurance Economy of India National Football League Players' Association Heather Wilson Economic rent Assignment (law) Slander and libel Mennonite Annuity Deposit Interest Retention Tax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Retirement plan Administrative law of the United States Employer identification number Tax treaty Brushaber v.
