when you own property do you also have to pay federal taxes i own property and i pay state taxes in my tax returns i have not said that i own property i do pay the state tax though i need to know if i am obligated to pay taxes to the federal govt as well unless you are renting the property or otherwise generating income from it you do not have to report it on your federal income tax return i'm guessing that the state taxes you pay are local property taxes the local property taxes that you pay can be reported on your schedule a as part of your itemized deductions but the house itself is not taxed unless you sell it at a profit or make some income off of rental Income tax United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the United States Tax Property tax Flat tax Operating surplus Renting Progressive tax Value added Taxation in the Republic of Ireland 401(k) Municipal bond FairTax Leasing Capital gains tax Income statement Regressive tax Economic rent Microeconomics Tax avoidance/evasion Dividend Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Insurance Value product Form 1040 Surplus value Mortgage Tax Reform Act of 1986 Value added tax Inheritance tax Tax protester Political subdivisions of New York State Social Security (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Income Double taxation Mobile home Article One of the United States Constitution Productive and unproductive labour Real estate bubble Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Tax deduction Profit Monopoly (game) Annuity Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Conservation easement Intermediate consumption Warren Buffett Goods and Services Tax (Canada) Wal-Mart Jim Gilmore Tax haven Pollock v.
