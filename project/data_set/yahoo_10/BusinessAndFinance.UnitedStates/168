how much estimated tax do i owe on the taxable part of my fellowships so i am a grad student and i've received some fellowships for the coming academic year they are as follows total all of it taxable because it will go toward living expenses so according to my calculations for federal estimated tax form f es my standard deduction is married filing jointly and i can claim two personal exemptions one for myself and one for my husband the total amount i can deduct from my gross income is therefore thus subtracting from in taxable income i would therefore not have to pay any estimated tax because the amount is below this just doesn't seem right to me that would essentially mean that i would be walking away with tax free also i have a salaried job that i've netted from and the federal govt has taken out about from can somebody please explain this tax mystery to me thanks i also have a salaried job that has withheld taxes do i have to take this into account when i list my gross income on the estimated taxes form i thought that gross income on the estimated taxes form was only for income that has not been taxed you must take into account your husband's income when you calculate your gross income that along with your earnings your taxable fellowships and any income from interest or dividends etc make up your gross income you need to take a look at how much is being withheld from your pay for income tax purposes to see if that is enough to cover what you would owe at the end of the year taking into account the standard deduction and the personal exemptions Taxation in the United States Tax Flat tax Income tax United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Social Security (United States) Gross domestic product 401(k) Tax deduction Inheritance tax Progressive tax Measures of national income and output Capital gains tax Insurance Tax haven Compensation of employees Income statement Surplus value Life insurance Student loan Value added tax Mutual fund Double taxation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Depreciation Personal finance Annuity Payroll Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Health insurance Municipal bond Income Corporation Capital accumulation National Insurance Tax bracket Value added Form 1040 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Graduate school Food Stamp Program Reaganomics Social Security debate (United States) Income trust Credit card Salary cap Horsepower Health savings account Derivative (finance) Property tax Unemployment benefit Profit Tax exemption Warren Buffett Productive and unproductive labour Wal-Mart Child support Operating surplus Inflation Self-employment Limited liability company Tertiary education fees in Australia Cost of capital Tax credit Supply-side economics Value product Variable universal life insurance Bond Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Non-profit organization Capitalism Goods and Services Tax (Canada) Salary Economy of India Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Wealth condensation Guaranteed minimum income Tax protester Welfare trap Tax resistance Intermediate consumption Registered Retirement Savings Plan Accounting methods Minimum wage Employee stock option Tax treaty Leasing U.S. public debt Alcohol fuel United States Postal Service Earned income tax credit
