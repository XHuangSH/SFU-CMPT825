can the irs take away your home if you aren't paying taxes as bostonian and several others have said the short answer is yes however that will be an absolute last resort they will attach a lien on it so you wouldn't be able to sell it until you settled your tax liability usually irs agents can be tough but if you treat them with respect and don't get upset and make a good faith effort to pay your taxes things will turn out ok btw you can ignore the tax protestor who says tom cryer proved the tax had no legal grounds he's wrong tom cryer was acquitted of willful failure to file charges which is a criminal charge the burden is on the prosecution to prove the defendant cryer knew they had a responsibility to pay taxes if the defendant can successfully convince the jury that he believes there isn't a law the jury must acquit it doesn't matter if his belief is correct or not this is one of the few situations where ignorance of the law is an excuse however civil proceedings will be following and there is nothing stopping the irs from placing a lien on any property that tom cryer may have besides his acquittal does not prove there is no legal basis for income taxes anymore than o j simpson's acquittal proves it is o k to kill your ex wife all of stormdevil's other comments are also equally frivolous good luck Tax protester Jury trial Double jeopardy Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Taxation in the United States Slander and libel Tom DeLay Plame affair Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Ronald Goldman Scots law Conspiracy Kent Hovind Burden of proof Microeconomics Criminal procedure Allodial title Tax Philosophical skepticism Flat tax 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Lawsuit Mortgage Apology (Plato) Hillary Rodham Clinton Wyatt Earp Ronnie Earle Hearsay Mumia Abu-Jamal Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Karl Rove Scientology and the legal system Abortion debate Theodicy Evan Mecham Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax 2004 Democratic National Convention ROC presidential election, 2004 Property (ownership right) Trust (Law) USA Atheism Separation of church and state Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Equal Protection Clause Tax resistance Domestic violence Motion (legal) Insanity defense Concurrent estate The Bill Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Criminal law Due process Tort reform Religion Law Corporation Jury Rick Santorum Presumption of innocence Tort Utilitarianism U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Evidence (law) Arguments for and against drug prohibition Criticism of libertarianism Non-aggression principle Fathers' rights Scientology controversy Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Bill Clinton Jim Bakker New Hampshire Supreme Court National Kidney Foundation Singapore Moore v.
