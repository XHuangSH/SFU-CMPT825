i have a tax related question please advise i have stocks i received from my father over the years and would like to use it to purchase a home perhaps years from now should i be selling it over the years to break it up or can i just sell it all as one lump sump before i decide to buy what are the pros and cons of each approach thanks sounds like there are few issues here that are rather complex because your issue is a related to a year future purchase of home tax law may change price of stock may change the stock you received was it a direct issue or is it attached to an entity for example a estate was the stock from all the same company is the stock held by you or is the stock held by the brokeage firm will be important to determine the purchasing price the other issue is the performace of the stock if the stock is performing very poorly it may be wise to sell it and convert it into something performing better or if it is stock from various companies there maybe loses that can offset some of the gain is the stock a high risk stock is the stock in ira plan what is your tax bracket now and your projected tax bracket and etc i would not be doing you a favor by suggesting any course of action when so many factors are unknown consider consulting a financial planner one that is a fee service planner not one that gets commissions on selling stock or a tax planner on this issue that you can provide the information to in detail and they can provide you a few options on courses of action i wish you well Mutual fund Insurance Bond Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Stock Mergers and acquisitions Social Security debate (United States) Corporation Hedge fund Taxation in the United States Personal finance Supply and demand Warren Buffett Annuity Corporate finance PE ratio Stock broker Wal-Mart Arbitrage 401(k) Gross domestic product Income trust Derivative (finance) Mortgage Investment bank Model (economics) Free trade Futures contract Internet fraud Deflation (economics) Stock market Finance Option Tax Hyperinflation Gold standard Financial markets Call option Short selling Economy of Russia Michael Milken Capital gains tax Tesco Kyoto Protocol Technical analysis FairTax Equity investment Strategic management Dividend Corporate governance Sears Holdings Corporation Bank Social Security (United States) Management Government debt PricewaterhouseCoopers Japan-United States relations Publicly funded medicine Margin (finance) Eliot Spitzer Temasek Holdings Day trading Rupert Murdoch Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Security (finance) Capital accumulation Electronic commerce Citigroup Cable television Capitalism Financial analyst RKO Pictures Speculation Real estate broker Berkshire Hathaway Insider trading Xerox Trade Credit card Information Services Procurement Library Islamic banking Timeline of the Enron scandal Public transport Natural monopoly Theory of the firm __lectricit__ de France Surplus value Stock market index Gold as an investment
