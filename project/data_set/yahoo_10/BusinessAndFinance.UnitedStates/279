donating computers for tax write offs i have a couple of computers sitting in storage that i don't use and i don't honestly know if they work one of them doesn't for sure the other one i just don't remember i want to get rid of these computers and i know there are places where i can donate these computers to be put back together and refurbished for schools and other charitable organizations i was curious how this applies to the concept of a tax writeoff and what benefit that has for me i don't know anything about this but it sounds like it might save me some money if not oh well but i would like to know a little bit more about it since i'm sure this won't be the last time i end up donating something i don't use to a charity or other organization thanks in advance it wouldn't be a tax write off but would be a non cash charitable contribution and would be deducted on schedule a itemized deductions under charity non cash the only thing is if one doesn't work it isn't worth much if anything at all and on donating something other than cash you get a donation for the market value of the item what it is worth so by donating a broken computer you would be donating something worth nothing and that is what you would get for a non cash deduction oh to get any benefit also from the non cash deduction you have to itemize as well with your total itemized deductions being more than your standard deduction ps kathy a is partly incorrect you can't donate to a person it has to be an organization donations to a person are not tax deductible also if you donate the computers this year you would report the donation on your schedule a which you will fill out in Flat tax Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Tax Charitable trust Taxation in the United States Theory of conduct Life insurance Non-profit organization Annuity Tax deduction FairTax Warren Buffett Social Security (United States) Wal-Mart National Insurance Health insurance School choice Tax bracket United Way Jeopardy!
