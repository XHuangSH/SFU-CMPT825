when it comes to taxes why wouldn't this work i have wondered when i go to work and finally get my paycheck we all notices the large chunk missing from taxes most everyone agrees that it stinks working for that money then have it taken away by the gov why does no one ever try and do it the other way around why cant the gov tax people on what they spend it seems like it would balance out if they left my work check alone and raised taxes on products we buy like food mountain dews the gas station just whatever why would that not work you could even tax things like ciggz and alcohol more than every day products but it seems like by raising sales tax and letting the worker keep their paycheck without taxes being taken people could save more money and be taxed for the things they buy if they dont buy alot then good for them they get to save up some money it just seems to me it would balance out if you just flipped it around i guess i feel discouraged to buy things when i do not have much of a paycheck i think i would feel more like saving or buying more things if i felt i had the money to do so those of us that are middle class or poor would pay a greater share of our income in this type of tax since we have less income than the rich do they would be buying the necessities just like we do and paying the tax on them but they'd still have much money left over to do whatever they wanted with compared to the middle class and the poor Tax FairTax Progressive tax Microeconomics Flat tax Capitalism Gross domestic product Taxation in the United States Value added tax Mutual fund Inflation Anarchism and capitalism Trickle down effect Economic inequality Deficit spending Keynesian economics Surplus value Economy of Russia 401(k) Canadian and American economies compared Free trade Economy of the United States Social Security (United States) Health insurance Price discrimination Credit card Supply and demand Outsourcing Life insurance Income Tax cut Islamic banking Publicly funded medicine Deflation (economics) Public transport Economy of India Betting (poker) Economy of Norway Great Depression Economy of Pakistan Measures of national income and output Public policy Commodity Galactic Civilizations Money Gold as an investment Make money fast Tax bracket Unemployment Tariff Internet fraud Wal-Mart Warren Buffett Hyperinflation Regressive tax Ocean's Twelve Biodiesel History of the United States (1918-1945) Anarchist economics United States Postal Service Reaganomics Wealth condensation Social class Security (finance) Tax resistance New Deal United Kingdom corporation tax Labour economics History of the United States (1980-1988) U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Article One of the United States Constitution U.S. public debt Debt Insurance Protectionism Apprenticeship Supply-side economics Externality Road pricing Personal finance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Unemployment benefit Arguments for and against drug prohibition Marshall Plan Wealth Guaranteed minimum income Compensation of employees The Amazing Race Primerica Financial Services Conker's Bad Fur Day Short selling Economy of Africa Labor theory of value Bulk vending Knots Landing Social Security debate (United States) Ethical consumerism
