does the irs ever make mistakes my girlfriend just received a letter saying she owes xx xxx from we filed a truthful tax form in and every yr previous and cant imagine why this is i just need some peace of mind someone to tell me that irs has been known to make mistakes thanks as a former irs drone a period of my life i refer to lovingly as that time i leased my soul i can tell you that mistakes can and do occur however the irs will make you prove it's a mistake and do not assume that you didn't do anything wrong so you can ignore it that's the fastest way to make absolutely certain you end up in a lot of trouble like they could start placing tax liens on any property she owns or even property you own jointly plus they could start garnishing her wages she needs to contact them and do it now it's entirely possible that someone has stolen her identity the latest thing in stolen identities is to steal a social security regardless of credit rating sell it to an illegal alien who then gets a job and doesn't pay taxes it may be years later but the irs will eventually catch it and guess why come after yep that's right this is also why you need to check to see if you have identity theft coverage on your homeowners tenant policy and or a stand alone policy sometimes credit card companies will offer it but those are almost always limited to how these things impact your credit and there are even worse things than having your credit screwed up like having the irs breathing down your neck seriously advise you girlfriend to get in touch with the irs as soon as possible and if she doesn't have a broad identity theft policy she needs to get one you can sometimes add it onto an existing homeowners tenant condo policy for or so a year good luck Insurance Taxation in the United States FairTax Password Microeconomics Bank fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Internet fraud Mortgage Capital accumulation Life insurance Plame affair Identity theft Property (ownership right) Tom DeLay 401(k) Tax Allodial title Capitalism Nintendo Auto insurance Variable universal life insurance Social Security (United States) Property tax United Kingdom corporation tax H-1B visa Wal-Mart Credit repair Intellectual property Theory of conduct Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Minimum wage EastEnders British national identity card Kent Hovind Annuity Arthur Laffer 2000 Australian Grand Prix Home insurance United States Postal Service Sin City Leasehold estate Corporation Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Income tax Contract George W.
