single menber llc company working for free my mother has a llc single member company im helping her with her business everyday i don't get any payment for that so its advisable that my mother include me like her employee could her business have any problem if irs find out that she has an employee and she doesn't declare me like that because i'm working for free what will be the advantage if she declare me how employee could she deduce more taxes if declares me employee thank you in advance great question first i know of no reason for the irs to be upset that you are working for your mother for free there could be an issue with her employing someone for less than the minimum wage but i don't think that applies to llcs who employ their children however you both may be unwittingly causing the family to overpay in taxes why first of all if you are under and you are working for an unincorporated family business you are exempt from paying social security medicare tax if you are under you don't have to pay futa tax second regardless how old you are the first so many thousands of income is federally tax free to you if you are claimed by your parents that amount in is if you are claiming yourself that amount rises to at least not only is that money federal tax free to you but your mother could be writing it off if you have children of your own you may even qualify for credits which means you get money from the irs even if you had nothing withheld so right there by not paying you you are losing tax savings remember whatever she pays you in income and fica taxes she gets to write off from her profits that means she saves federal taxes and fica taxes if she is in the tax bracket when you consider fica taxes she saves around for every she pays you had she given you in she would have saved in taxes she saves more if she is in a higher tax bracket the savings may be greater when you factor in state taxes but each state is different so i can't comment further the mere fact that you are probably in a lower tax bracket means even if you don't consider your standard deductions or fica situation the family is losing out as if all that weren't enough you could be putting money away for retirement if you had income you could shelter up to of into a traditional ira in so if you claim yourself and are not married or have dependents the first your mother pays you is federal tax free you pocket and you put into your traditional ira no federal taxes at all of course you could also put money into a roth ira which i would recommend if you don't need the write off but it won't lower your taxable income please consider all the ramifications first but in general paying children to work in the family business is not only a good learning experience for everyone parent learns how to pay employees using a w child gets a paycheck and learns how to do his her tax return and learns about saving for retirement it can also save the family lots of money in taxes Tax Microeconomics FairTax Life insurance Social Security debate (United States) Health insurance Insurance Income tax United Kingdom corporation tax Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Minimum wage Reaganomics Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Publicly funded medicine Variable universal life insurance Inflation Roth IRA Capitalism Supply-side economics Annuity Limited liability company Self-employment National Insurance Keynesian economics Tax bracket Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capital accumulation Gross domestic product Surplus value Corporation Health savings account Mutual fund U.S. Internal Revenue Service Tax protester Divorce Tax avoidance/evasion Credit card Dividend Income trust Wal-Mart Deflation (economics) Unemployment Article One of the United States Constitution Arthur Laffer Education in the United States George W.
