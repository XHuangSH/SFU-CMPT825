will i have to pay taxes if i claimed for witholding but im really a ok so heres the situation i live in california i just graduated from college and i am making a year i am single no property nothing i claim myself in my taxes not my parents so the question is i filed for my taxes so every paycheck is slightly bigger since the government doesnt take as much however when it comes to april and i claim what i really am a one will i end up paying taxes thanks maybe maybe not for most taxpayers in your situation claiming withholding allowances will just about zero you out with uncle sam at filing time you may have a tiny bill to pay or get a tiny refund you'll usually be within about either way of even money this is really the ideal situation i hate making interest free loans to the government so i usually set my withholding up to result in a modest debt at filing time as long as it's less than there's no chance of any penalties though there are other ways out of the penalty box as well personally i shoot for a debt at tax time it gives me the max in my paychecks on payday and is a managable bill for me to pay at filing time United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Social Security (United States) Tax Child support Flat tax Tax protester Tax resistance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Life insurance Article One of the United States Constitution Capital gains tax Government debt Allodial title Credit card Donald Trump Deflation (economics) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Income tax Trust (Law) USA Money Publicly funded medicine Hyperinflation Personal finance April 2005 in Canada 401(k) Unemployment benefit Usury Salary cap United States Postal Service Progressive tax Security (finance) Property tax History of the United States (1789-1849) Wal-Mart Capitalism Mortgage Annuity Tax cut 613 mitzvot Warren Buffett Dividend imputation Craps Social Security debate (United States) U.S. public debt Payday loan Form 1040 Primerica Financial Services Reaganomics Bond H-1B visa Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Hillary Rodham Clinton British House of Commons Jizya Tariff Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Tax credit 2003 California recall Payroll 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Corporation Debt Islamic banking Bank fraud Parliament of the United Kingdom Balanced Budget Amendment Economy of the United States Tom DeLay Public good Canadian Senate Credit score Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Barbara Boxer Milton Friedman Economy of India Christine Gregoire Deposit Interest Retention Tax Tom Brinkman Individual Savings Account Economic history of the United States Municipal bond Bretton Woods system Privatization Brian Mulroney Subsidy Free market William Pitt the Younger Government of Maryland U.S. Internal Revenue Service Non-aggression principle Insurance Stock
