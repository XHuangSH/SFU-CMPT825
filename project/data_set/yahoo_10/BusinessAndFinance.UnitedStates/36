irs notices who do they go after my buddy who is separated from his wife recieved a letter from the irs saying they are putting a federal tax lien on his properities well this is being filed for a tax year that he filed jointly with his wife back in but he had mentioned to me that the irs notices only have his social security number on them and not hers his x wife even though they are both equally responsible for whatever debt was accrued for that tax year so now that this notice was sent does this mean that his x wife's properities will also have a lien against them even though her social security number isn't on the notices or just his property your friend needs to meet with a tax expert if the property is only in his name then he will be the only on listed on the notice something does not seem right also he may be able to claim innocent spouse he needs professional advice now Taxation in the United States Marriage Tax protester Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Canadian Senate Kent Hovind Flat tax FairTax Child support Social Security (United States) Concurrent estate Domestic partnerships in California 401(k) Mortgage Insurance Allodial title U.S. Internal Revenue Service Treasury security H-1B visa Income tax Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Domestic violence Limited liability company Retirement plan Roth IRA United Kingdom corporation tax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Civil unions in the United Kingdom Benny Hinn Progressive tax Foreclosure Article One of the United States Constitution Politics of Russia Plame affair Student loan Tammy Faye Life insurance Employer identification number Bond Lien Chan National Insurance George W.
