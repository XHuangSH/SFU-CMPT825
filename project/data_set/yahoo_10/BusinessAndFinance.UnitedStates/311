writing of the cost of a pool i have heard that it would be possible to deduct the cost of a pool for medical reasons i have a medical condition that warrents water tharepy what would i need to do to qualify for this write off and how would i go about it let's say my agi is about k and i can put a pool in for about k how will this effect my taxes will it just bring my agi down to k or will i be able to recoup that money in some way trying to figure out if i can do this and how i can pay for it because i don't have k sitting around can i write off the payments for a loan to install the pool what about the surrounding landscaping i've read somewhere that you could write off the landscaping around a wheelchair ramp along with the cost of the ramp does that apply to landscaping around the pool thanks in advance for you advice you would need to get your doctor to write that the pool is needed for medical reasons and what you would be able to deduct would be the difference between what the pool would cost to put in and what the value of your home would increase if the pool cost k and the value of your home goes up k then you would be able to deduct only the k difference and where you would have to put the deduction would be on schedule a itemized deductions under medical expenses writing off the payments for the loan would not be deductible because then you would be taking the deduction twice once for the cost of the pool and the nd time for paying for the cost of the pool you might be able to deduct the interest that you pay on the pool loan surrounding landscape would not be deductible as there would be no medical reason for the landscaping Insurance Life insurance 401(k) Health insurance United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Taxation in the United States Mortgage Flat tax Publicly funded medicine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Student loan Tax Mutual fund Education in the People's Republic of China Credit card Gross domestic product Microeconomics Education in Germany Employee stock option Surplus value Divorce Bond Intellectual property Copyleft Sport utility vehicle Productive and unproductive labour Profit Compensation of employees Wal-Mart Natural deduction Depreciation Education in Japan Income tax Cost of capital Education in the United States Apprenticeship Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Income trust Child support Operating surplus SAT Microcredit Economic rent Inflation Toilet Health care in the United States Government National Mortgage Association Islamic banking Hyperinflation Graduate school Mergers and acquisitions Tariff Food Stamp Program Unemployment benefit Tax avoidance/evasion Charitable trust Capital accumulation Debt Supply-side economics Salary cap Deflation (economics) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Trade union Personal finance Tertiary education fees in Australia Public transport Canada Health Act Government debt Donald Trump Economy of Russia Medical malpractice Bretton Woods system Food and Drug Administration Auto insurance Solar power National Insurance Bosniaks Primerica Financial Services Form 1040 Economy of the United States Opportunity cost Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Gold standard Sherlock Holmes Hybrid vehicle Canadian federal election, 1965 School choice American Medical Association Capitalism Welfare trap School of Salamanca Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Medicare (United States) Income statement
