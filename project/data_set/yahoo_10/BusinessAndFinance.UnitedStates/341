ebay irs question i have a question about claiming income from ebay selling if i lets say buy a book at a garage sale for then i sell it on ebay for if the book's original retail value was do i still have to claim my income from that since i am still selling it for under it's original value technically you would have a gain on that sale you purchased an item for and sold it for a gain and that would be reportable income to the irs gain loss is based on your actualy purchase sale price now you can also factor expenses like the mileage on your car to go to and from the garage sale at the standard mileage rate of cents mile you might just get up to the sales price and owe no taxes in the end i hope that helps Taxation in the United States FairTax Tax Auto insurance Microeconomics Amazon.com Auction Bulk vending United Kingdom corporation tax Insurance Wal-Mart Electronic commerce Progressive tax Capital gains tax Value added tax Gross domestic product Hyperinflation Mutual fund Best Buy U.S. Internal Revenue Service Internet fraud E85 Arbitrage Income statement Day trading Filling station Tesco Inflation Airline Supply and demand Gold as an investment Video game crash of 1983 Retailer Ford Motor Company Accounting methods First-sale doctrine $ale of the Century Advertising Surplus value Bond Textbook Short selling Airsoft Price discrimination Supermarket Biodiesel Life insurance Hard disk Dot-com Flat tax Citigroup Live 8 Islamic banking De Lorean DMC-12 Ford Thunderbird Mortgage Form 1040 Publishing MAME MMORPG Monetary policy Predatory lending Neopets Income tax Illegal drug trade Commodity Canadian and American economies compared Grey market Lionel, LLC Management information system Nintendo Battery electric vehicle Amway Topps Productive and unproductive labour Inventory ITunes Music Store The Apprentice 2 Mergers and acquisitions Videocassette recorder Wayne Corporation Measures of national income and output Hybrid vehicle Hot Coffee mod Temasek Holdings Sales IPod Fuel efficiency Network effect Virtual economy Pricing W H Smith Sales tax Moonshine Sears Holdings Corporation Publicly funded medicine 401(k) Grand Theft Auto III American Broadcasting Company Leasing
