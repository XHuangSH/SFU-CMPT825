does the irs tax your income from ebay i don't run an ebay store but i do sell stuff on ebay from time to time if i want some extra vacation money etc do i have to claim this at the end of the year thanks how does the irs know if i am making a profit or not if you make a profit on your sale then it's taxable however if you're selling used items on e bay you often sell for less than you purchased the item for in that case you're selling at a loss and don't have to claim any of the funds to the irs for example if you bought golf clubs for sold them on e bay for you would claim nothing as income if you bought golf clubs for sold them for on ebay then you'd have to claim as income on your federal tax return i hope that helps 401(k) Tax FairTax Mutual fund Flat tax Tax protester Islamic banking Value added tax Wal-Mart Progressive tax Variable universal life insurance Microeconomics Life insurance U.S. Internal Revenue Service Internet fraud Insurance Live 8 Municipal bond Health insurance Short selling Electronic commerce Amazon.com Arbitrage Auction Video game crash of 1983 Neopets Income tax Surplus value Dot-com Limited liability company Income statement World Cricket Tsunami Appeal Corporation Article One of the United States Constitution Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Loss leader Textbook First-sale doctrine Tesco Carl G.
