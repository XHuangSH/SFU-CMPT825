adding a balcony additional taxes hi i've been looking to add a balcony to the second floor of my parent's home it would be large around x and be situated over a driveway i do understand a permit needs to be obtained for such a structure but i was wondering if the house and property would be taxed at higher rates since the value of the property would probably be increased is there any estimation on how much more expensive this would be we are located in queens ny thanks for reading of course the house and property would be taxed at a higher rate no idea as to how much higher though you'd have to find out roughly how much in value it would add and what the tax rate is for you in queens Tax Property tax Taxation in the United States Insurance Microeconomics Education in the United States Annuity FairTax Flat tax Easement Government debt Inflation Surplus value Divorce United Kingdom corporation tax Stairway Income tax Gross domestic product 401(k) Alcohol fuel Life insurance Steel Economy of Russia Expert system Mortgage Sport utility vehicle McMansion Social Security (United States) Capitalism Social Security debate (United States) Capital gains tax Economy of India Real estate bubble White House Free trade Taxation in the Republic of Ireland California Proposition 13 (1978) Monopoly (game) Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 E85 Biodiesel Galactic Civilizations Labour economics Redundant array of independent disks Salary cap Capital accumulation Cerritos, California Inheritance tax Progressive tax Monopsony Intelligence quotient Education Mobile home Polytomous Rasch model Regressive tax Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center Income trust Cost of capital Keynesian economics Unemployment Nuclear weapon design Productive and unproductive labour Mutual fund Wind power Alberta Tariff Article One of the United States Constitution CPU design Causality Airline Twelve leverage points Jersey Explosive material Nuclear power Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Warren Buffett Gas metal arc welding CPU cache Value added Contract with America Minimum wage Literacy Parliament of Canada DVD Open cluster Urban sprawl Politics of Canada Australian constitutional law Credit card Economy of the Republic of Ireland Manitoba Hydro Pisco Reaganomics LIFO Pilot certification in the United States British monarchy Supply and demand Speed limit
