is paying taxes constitutional i have often thought about the number of times we pay tax on a good in the usa example a seed producer charges tax upon selling the seeds to a farmer the farmer grows wheat and again pays tax on selling is wheat to a bread maker the bread maker sells loafs of bread to a store and pays a tax the store sells the bread to the consumer and we pay tax this is just an example and some think i have often thought about we paid to times tax on the same item nope you don't understand our tax laws we don't have a gst in the us we have a sales tax the farmer doesn't pay taxes on his seeds neither does the baker or the store and you don't pay sales taxes on the bread either because it's a staple unlike canada and europe the us doesn't have a gst which puts a tax throughout the whole production process in the us some states impose a sales tax the tax is on non essential goods and serives and is only imposed upon the end consumer Goods and Services Tax (Canada) Bread Value added tax Microeconomics Supply and demand Tariff Organic food Taxation in the United States Alcoholic beverage Money FairTax Brian Mulroney Public good Agricultural policy Wheat Sales tax Wal-Mart Agriculture Cereal Organic certification Food Surplus value Protectionism Supermarket Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Credit card Subsidy Prohibition Mortgage Commodity Illegal drug trade Bagel Bulk vending Sugar Barley Cigarette Economy of the United States Taxation in Canada Monsanto Harmonized Sales Tax Keynesian economics Free trade Internet fraud United Kingdom corporation tax Legal issues of cannabis Capital accumulation Hemp Genetically modified food Famine Excise Gross domestic product Electronic commerce Productive and unproductive labour Intellectual property Dairy Poll tax Advertising Progressive tax Gold as an investment Biodiesel Stamp Act Economic history of Canada Inventory Economy of Poland Capitalism Citigroup Corporation Income statement Filling station Inflation Law of value Supply-side economics Green Revolution White bread Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporate farming Copyleft Mutual fund Retailer Acorn Life insurance Value product Serfdom Trademark Great Depression Flat tax Measures of national income and output Costco Contract Income tax Organic farming Health insurance History of the United States (1918-1945) Flax Goods and Services Tax (Australia) Marginalism Kosher foods
