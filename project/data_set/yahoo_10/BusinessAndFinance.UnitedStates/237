tax question relating to a gift of real estate i asked similar question before but need more opinions i work for a company that lays out and designs residential subdivision projects my boss is the owner of the company and we've been lifelong friends he has worked out a deal with a developer wherein instead of charging our normal fees for designing his project the developer is going to give my boss lots in the development each of these lots will be valued at approximately dollars my boss has said he is going to outright give me one of the three lots i'm trying to figure out the best way to do this so that it minimizes the tax hit on both of us my boss and i have a side company we set up this year an llc with he and i as the only partners its purpose is to buy and develop real estate so my questions are if my boss gives me a lot is it considered a bonus and thus taxable as income or is it a gift what are the tax implications of the latter if that's what it is would there be any advantage to see more below question continued would there be any advantage in my boss deeding my lot over to our llc or would the tax rate be even higher question another alternative my boss is considering is for the developer to deed him lots and then deed the other lot to me this way my boss is not involved in the transaction of me receiving my lot is there any tax advantage to doing it that way we're just looking for legal strategies to effect this transfer that would cause the least amount of tax hit to both of us any advice or other options would be appreciated wayne z what if my boss gifted the lot to my wife instead of to me please understand neither me nor my boss is trying to get away with anything we're simply looking for the best legal strategy to minimize our tax burden we're not interested in violating any laws i don't think there's any way out of this normally gifts are not taxable to the person who receives it but in this case the lots would take the place of the fee so your boss has income equal to the value of the lots at the time he receives them he possibly could gift you a lot and there would be no tax affect to you but the irs would probably challenge it and say that it was a bonus you might win and you might lose if it is a gift to you which if he's not in the habit of giving you a bonus after a successful job it could wind up as a gift considering you've been lifelong friends then there is no tax to you for receiving the gift but there would be taxes when you sold the lot if you held the lot for more than year it would be taxed to you as long term capital gain which is taxed at a maximum rate of for those in the or brackets your boss would also have capital gains taxes as well if he sold his lots for more than they were worth when he receives them i don't think you both can avoid taxes but i have given you my best idea to minimize them Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Tax Life insurance Corporation United Kingdom corporation tax Inheritance tax FairTax Progressive tax Mortgage Property tax Leasing Annuity 401(k) Insurance Surplus value Variable universal life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capital accumulation Easement Tax avoidance/evasion Capital gains tax Supply and demand Dividend Income tax Tax haven Rule in Shelley's Case Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Limited liability company Gross domestic product Labor theory of value Express trust Trust (Law) USA Monopoly (game) Tax protester Islamic banking Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Wheel of Fortune Supply-side economics Inflation Municipal bond Warren Buffett Capitalism Credit card Democracy Stamp duty Microcredit GNU General Public License Donald Trump Bretton Woods system Wealth Bond Minimum wage Guild Wars Property (ownership right) Prices of production Allodial title Tax bracket Poker jargon Hedge fund Real property Reaganomics Salary cap Derivative (finance) Expert system Health insurance Alex Ferguson Contract Monetary policy Social Security (United States) Ra (board game) Estoppel MMORPG Intellectual property Economic rent Copyright Trust (Law) non-USA Urban sprawl Theory of conduct Free trade Money Dividend imputation Concurrent estate Security (finance) Labor-power Value added tax Advance fee fraud Education in the United States Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution LiveJournal Economic inequality
