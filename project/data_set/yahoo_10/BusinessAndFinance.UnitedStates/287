claiming too few withholding allowances on w big refund i have a friend who is claiming too few withholding allowances on his w he believes that his withholding allowance on w should be the same number as his personal exceptions on ez i told him the number are often the same but in his case he can claim higher he claims for himself and his son but according to the w he can claim why should i worry about this because he lives paycheck to paycheck and often borrows money from friends until refund day when the tax refund comes back he also pays company xyz to give a speedy refund he always complains to me about money woes when i asked him to change the number on the w he at first told me that was illegal to state a higher number then household people after i shown him a w he changed the argument to i like my big returns i don't want to owe money to the irs how can i blow this argument out of the water is there a benefit to the uncle sam saving program thanks for the advice what would your son do with the extra money he would get from having less taken out of his paycheck would he save it use it for needed things or would he blow it if he would blow it then he's better off getting the bigger refund if he would handle the extra money wisely then he would be better off with the extra money in his paycheck just not so much that he does end up owing the irs Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) FairTax Flat tax Child support Variable universal life insurance Tax Tax resistance Insurance Knots Landing 401(k) Progressive tax Microeconomics U.S. Internal Revenue Service Bank fraud Ayyavazhi mythology Life insurance St. Elmo's Fire (film) Tax protester 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Public good Tax credit Social Security debate (United States) Publicly funded medicine Warren Buffett Islamic banking Octopus card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wal-Mart Debt Income tax Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Earned income tax credit Article One of the United States Constitution Politics of Canada Socrates Royal Assent 613 mitzvot H-1B visa Plame affair Big Brother UK series 6 Primerica Financial Services Bond Employee stock option Jizya Craps Capitalism Costco Voluntary Student Unionism Outsourcing 1957 World Series Tax bracket EastEnders Health insurance Common criticisms of Microsoft Meaning of life Tom DeLay Enron Corporation Privatization Inflation London Congestion Charge Money Ron Arnold Extras (sitcom) Ponzi scheme Theory of conduct Wyatt Earp Humphrey Bogart Estoppel Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 United Kingdom corporation tax Education in the United States Supply-side economics Oil-for-Food Programme Capital gains tax Student loan Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Newcastle United F.C.
