tax questions i just started a job for a carrier or messenger company where i use my own car for my job what can i get back at the end of the year what receipts should i keep i do live in california if you keep a mileage log that supports the business miles not commuting you can choose to deduct cents mi or apportion your actual expenses based on business total mileage when you pick one method over another you are stuck with that method for the life of the car once you calculate the deduction it will flow through to schedule a of your return less of your agi assuming you already itemize and make say you would need to rack up mi before you reach any benefit though tax prep fees and a few other deductions can offset the level i would suggest your talk to your employer regarding an accountable reimbursement plan even if it means your salary is less it maybe worth having your employer require you turn in mileage logs on a monthly basis from which the company reimburses you at a standard rate if the rate is above cents mi the excess is w income if the rate you are reimbursed is less the difference can go to schedule a these reimbursements under an accountabl plan are not part of your w income so it essentially gives you a deduction without the hassel remember though under an accountable plan the employer must only reimburse you for supported expenses not a flat rate of a month any such plan would result in the entire amount being wages no matter what your turned in if you need to sell your employer on implementing an accountable plan point out that by doing so the employer will save money on employment taxes but still get the business deduction of what leaves the company's checking account this benefit is of course only if the employee's wage is lowered to account for the reimbursed mileage Tax Insurance FairTax Taxation in the United States Flat tax United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Social Security (United States) Gross domestic product Credit card 401(k) Inflation Publicly funded medicine Life insurance Annuity Food Stamp Program Social Security debate (United States) Auto insurance Primerica Financial Services Income tax Health savings account Warren Buffett Hybrid vehicle Reaganomics Value added tax Wal-Mart Monetary policy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United States Postal Service E85 Supply-side economics National Insurance Student loan Minimum wage Income trust Mutual fund Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Health insurance Progressive tax Labour economics Personal finance Mortgage Surplus value Labor theory of value Unemployment Dividend Gold standard Income statement Education in the People's Republic of China Supply and demand Measures of national income and output Solar cell Capitalism Employee stock option Principal-agent problem Economic inequality National Kidney Foundation Singapore Outsourcing Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Arthur Laffer Arbitrage Airline Government National Mortgage Association Cost accounting Taxicab Accounting methods Efficiency wages Affirmative action George W.
