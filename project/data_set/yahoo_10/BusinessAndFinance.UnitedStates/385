just married this year file taxes jointly or seperately hi my husband and i just got married this year i worked full time from jan through june and will be a student for the rest of the year i have also just taken out a student loan for this fall my husband will have worked under the table the entire year so his income is untaxed there is no record technically he does not work oh and he is not a student either we have lived together the entire year how does the dependent thing work and would it be better for us to file jointly or seperately this coming jan bad move to marry a blatant tax evader that made it more likely that he'll be caught and now your assets are fair game for the irs when they go after back taxes and penalties whether to file jointly or not is a small issue compared to the issue of criminality i'd suggest you see a lawyer who deals with tax issues and decide how to handle this you cannot claim a spouse as a dependent there are various rules for claiming other people you support as dependents children parents siblings friends etc but there is no way to claim a spouse as a dependent however each spouse gets one automatic personal exemption which is just as good it is extremely rare that filing separately leads to lower taxes than filing jointly Flat tax Marriage 401(k) FairTax Divorce Taxation in the United States Tax Student loan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Inheritance tax Civil unions in the United Kingdom Roth IRA Polygamy 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Tax protester Grief Incest Family Concurrent estate Economic inequality Capital gains tax Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States Polyamory Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Property tax Social Security (United States) Pretty Good Privacy Centrelink Insurance Irish nationality law U.S. Internal Revenue Service H-1B visa Tax exemption Theory of conduct Hillary Rodham Clinton History of British nationality law Game programmer Immigration to the United States Constitution of Ireland British Royal Family Same-sex marriage Article One of the United States Constitution Copyright law of the United Kingdom Probate LiveJournal Video game developer CPU cache Lawsuit Philip II of Spain Wal-Mart Poker jargon Unification Church Education in the United States Kyoto Protocol Microeconomics Civil union Slander and libel Royal Assent Appeal Free trade Tax resistance Alimony Cricket Domestic violence Unlawful combatant Allodial title Municipal bond Ethics Age of consent Fischer Random Chess Life insurance Illegal drug trade Bankruptcy Redundant array of independent disks Variable universal life insurance Progressive tax Unemployment benefit Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Blackjack Trust (Law) non-USA Income tax Court system of Canada Regressive tax National Insurance Virtual memory Culture of the United States Daylight saving time Murder British nationality law Federal Marriage Amendment EastEnders Child support Productive and unproductive labour Family name Child pornography Intelligence quotient Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 Enterprise content management
