can i legally claim on my tax return ok here is my question my friend who works with me at a local hospital says that you can legallyl claim as an exemtion x times per year so she does this when we have checks a month and our insurance premiums and stuff are not deducted to get more money so lets say times a year ive heard that you dont have to file taxes every year if you dont owe you may do it every years but ive never heard of this what would happen your return would be less anyone have a clue what i am talking about and can offer an answer because i dont want to do this if its gonna land me in the hotseat the only way you can claim on your tax return is if you had yourself and dependents or yourself a spouse and dependents your friend is dead wrong it is true that you don't have to file every year but that is only if you don't have taxable income and any federal or state withholdings if you owe money you need to file a tax return and pay what you owe and if you are owed a refund you need to file a tax return to claim the refund Taxation in the United States Tax Flat tax Life insurance FairTax United Kingdom corporation tax Insurance Income tax Social Security (United States) Annuity United States Postal Service 401(k) Child support Health insurance Tax protester Mutual fund Inheritance tax Progressive tax Publicly funded medicine Tax resistance Credit card Microeconomics Student loan Variable universal life insurance Capital gains tax Medicare (United States) Unemployment benefit Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Wal-Mart Auto insurance Warren Buffett Mortgage SCO-Linux controversies Tom DeLay Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax bracket Form 1040 Article One of the United States Constitution Municipal bond Tax exemption Payroll Health savings account Earned income tax credit Social rule Income trust Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Contract U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Bond Tax avoidance/evasion Tax haven GNU General Public License Allodial title Social Security debate (United States) Bank fraud Reparations for slavery Enron Corporation Octopus card Charles Ives Value added tax 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Education in the United States George W.
