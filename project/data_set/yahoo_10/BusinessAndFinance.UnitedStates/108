how would one catch up on years of back taxes i recently took over the finances of my dad he's years old and has advanced kidney failure he's self employed and deals mostly with cash and checks i've recently discovered that he hasn't paid taxes in years i need to get him caught up as he's going to need social security benefits soon how would one even begin to do this gather up all of his records and take them to a cpa if he doesn't have records could be very difficult but talk to a cpa anyway they might find a way to reconstruct the records but that will take a lot of their time and therefore cost quite a bit he's going to actually have to pay the taxes not just file for the time to count for social security Social Security (United States) Enron Corporation Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Accountancy Gross domestic product Tax Coalition Provisional Authority Warren Buffett Life insurance Pension FairTax Insurance Credit card Bank fraud Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax American Institute of Certified Public Accountants New Deal Financial audit Social welfare H-1B visa Retirement plan Child support Unemployment benefit Mutual fund Publicly funded medicine Unemployment Income trust Productive and unproductive labour Citigroup Social Security debate (United States) Payroll L.
