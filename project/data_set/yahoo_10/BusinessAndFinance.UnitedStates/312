how many taxes will be taken out of my lawsuit settlement i just won a settlement for compensatory damages and punitive damages how much tax will be taken out of the compensatory i know that the for punitive will not be taxed that depends upon what the settlement is for settlements for physical injury or illness are not taxed if any part of the settlement is earmarked for lost wages interest or punitive damages that portion is fully taxable as ordinary income additionally settlements that simply make you whole again are not taxable for example if an uninsured drunk driver slammed into your house and the settlement was to repair the damage to your home it would not be taxable to the extent that it was used for the actual repairs any amount above and beyond the actual cost of the repairs would be taxable as ordinary income not sure where you heard that punitive damages are not taxable punitive damages are always taxable the only exception to that is if your state's laws prohibit the award of punitive damages in that case they would be treated as compensatory damages and would be taxable or not depending upon the reason for the settlement so without knowing what the settlement was for it's not possible to give an absolute answer to your question Damages Negligence Insurance Taxation in the United States FairTax Flat tax Tax 401(k) Income tax Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stella Liebeck v.
