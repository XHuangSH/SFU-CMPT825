i am thinking about being an independent contractor but i need to to know about the tax aspect of it i am planning to take over my best friend's job when she leaves in weeks but it is an independent contractor type of position and i want to know the tax side of that before i completely agree what are the tax rules and what is the best way to handle them as an independent contractor you'll need to pay both sides of the social security and medicare tax fica both employer and employee this means an extra tax just make sure that your hourly wage is higher as a result of this additionally you probably don't get any benefits medical or otherwise as an independent contractor but if you already have health insurance from another source this isn't a problem for you make sure to make estimated tax payments since the company will not be withholding taxes from your paycheck you'll need to send in quarterly estimates to the irs and your state if you live in a state that taxes income i'd suggest contacting a cpa to help you with figuring out how to deal with the estimates if you don't want to deal with it yourself good luck in your new job Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Insurance Tax Health insurance Flat tax Unemployment Microeconomics Self-employment Social Security debate (United States) Medicare (Canada) FairTax Gross domestic product Progressive tax Minimum wage Life insurance Income tax Publicly funded medicine 401(k) Unemployment benefit National Insurance Wal-Mart Economy of the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Labour economics Canadian and American health care systems compared Compensation of employees Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Pension U.S. Internal Revenue Service Taxation in Canada Canadian federal election, 1965 Surplus value US health reform under FDR Reaganomics Productive and unproductive labour Capitalism Child support Variable universal life insurance Government debt HIPAA Barbara Boxer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Income trust Keynesian economics Medicaid National Health Service Economy of India Earned income tax credit Capital accumulation Affirmative action Social Security Administration Monopsony Economy of Russia Heather Wilson Trade union H-1B visa Hillary Rodham Clinton Economic inequality Politics of Canada New Deal Retirement plan Tariff Actuary Welfare trap Kyoto Protocol Inflation United States labor law Celtic Tiger Tax protester Social security ITV Mortgage Health savings account Great Depression Warren Buffett Tax resistance Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare (Australia) Tax credit Free trade U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Air traffic controller Efficiency wages George W.
