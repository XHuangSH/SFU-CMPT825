what happens if you filed as single but should have filed as married i got married outside of the us to a foreign national i lived and worked in the us up until august of last year then left the us to move to my husband's country my parents filed my tax claim in my absence but they filed me as single instead of married i've already received my return and wasn't audited but i'm wondering if there is any way the irs could find out that i filed mistakenly and if i could be penalized for it i e when i send them a copy of my marriage certificate in order to have my last name updated in their records thanks in advance you need to file an amended return since you were married you cannot file as single unless your non resident alien husband agrees to have his income taxed by the us as well you must file as married filing separately get a copy of form x and file the amended return you will be facing penalties and interest on any tax due and these will continue to mount until you file the amended return and pay the tax due the mere fact that you have not been audited yet means nothing the irs has until april to audit your return United Kingdom corporation tax Tax protester Taxation in the United States H-1B visa Flat tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Public domain Constitution of Ireland U.S. Internal Revenue Service Scientology Lawrence v.
