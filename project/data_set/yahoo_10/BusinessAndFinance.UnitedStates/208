when should i get my refund i turned in my state w 's and ez form but i also sent in an amended return with it because i forgot to calculate an additional w with my original return but i mailed these all at once because i realized what i did before i went ahead and sent in my original form i think i sent everything in about april may they said on the automated system it can take up to but i think its been longer than this just asking on here cause its too late to call right now when should i get my return days was also curious what is the possibility that it got lost in the mail or they didn't recieve it guess thats what im mainly concerned about i don't care when i get it just that they received it thanks i actually have copies of everything just never got around to calling thanks lol ah thats a great question i should have did that too late now i guess thanks for replying if you had just corrected the original return and sent it you would have had your refund by now but with you sending a ez with a x at the same time followed by a corrected ez you opened a can of worms the only thing that might help speed up the process is to call the irs and explain what you did they can forward the information to the service center to notify them that the singular return is the correct return and to disregard the first ez and the x you never send an original with an amended return or United States Postal Service Gmail Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail E-mail spam Public-key cryptography Mail Plame affair Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Password 2005 United States Grand Prix Global Positioning System Post office Francis Crick Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 11001001 (TNG episode) GSM services Daylight saving time Redundant array of independent disks Error correction and detection Many-worlds interpretation Battles of Lexington and Concord Richard Feynman Theodore Kaczynski Web crawler The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Enterprise content management Tax protester Age of the Earth ZIP Code Social Security (United States) Theory of conduct Modem Quantum computer A Course In Miracles Black hole Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Domain Name System Tic-Tac-Dough Card Sharks CPU cache U.S. Internal Revenue Service Morse Code Tennessee State Constitution I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Buffer overflow Evan Mecham Backup Intelligent design Internet forum Jumpstart 3rd Grade Shaggy dog story Time travel Voynich manuscript Credit card fraud 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Debugging Social rule Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) The writing of Principia Mathematica Speech synthesis Expert system Win, Lose or Draw Table tennis Iraq and weapons of mass destruction FidoNet IBM PC compatible Royal Assent Computer security Crossword Bush v.
