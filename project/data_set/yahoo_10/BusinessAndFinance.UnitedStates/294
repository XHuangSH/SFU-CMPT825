earned income tax credit my daughter is has a year old son she still lives at home and makes under thousand a year as a housekeeper for the last i have been claiming her and her son for earned income credit last year was the first year she has ever filed taxes and this will be her second year filing taxes she is upset that again i am going to claim her and her son on my taxes and get earned income credit for both of them she feels that she should be able to do it or both of us be able to do it also i know we both can not claim her son on both our taxes my question is who has more right to claim him her or me yes i pay for most of everything through out the year i told her i would give her part of the money from eitc but she doesnt want that she wants it all my big problem is i really do not want my year old have that much money at one time help her answer is on the form if you provide more than half of her support she is your dependant anyone falls under this category whther they are minors adults or whatever if she claims eitc with in wages she will get nothing it's called 'earned income' for a reason the more you make the more credit you get and more money she will get ten times as much if she lets you claim her and her son than if she claimed her son as 'head of household' which legally she cannot it's pretty simple math and simple logic eitc is given to people to encourage them to get better jobs eventually earning enough to not qualify anymore at she probably won't qualify to get any money at all if she is a student she is exempt from paying taxes up to a certain amount but she still must file a year old who earns over a year must file a tax return even though he wouldn't owe any taxes bottom line is she will shoot herself in the foot by demanding that you not claim her and her child on your tax return not only that she has no legal right to enforce that you are legally entitled to claim her and her child on your tax return as dependents if they recieve more than half of their support from you support includes living expenses like mortgage rent food utilities and clothing diapers yearly amounts divided by the number of people in the house if there are three of you living in the house and your mortgage is she would have to give you per month div by x her and son div by anything less means that you provide more than half of her living expense just for housing and so on with other expenses if she doesn't cover half of her own expenses she cannot claim eitc at all tell her life isn't fair it isn't fair that you have to provide for a baby that she made in the back seat of a car it isn't fair that you have to babysit a grandchild so she can do whatever it is she does while you're babysitting the same applies if she's or age is irrelevant a dependent is anyone who receives more than half of their support from you Minimum wage FairTax Taxation in the United States Flat tax Earned income tax credit Insurance Life insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Tax Mortgage Social Security (United States) Bond Personal finance Education in the United States U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Property tax Money Student loan Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Surplus value Economic inequality Credit card Progressive tax Mutual fund Tax protester Tom DeLay National Insurance Corporation Centrelink Tax bracket Unemployment benefit Abortion debate Allodial title Inflation Gross domestic product Poker jargon Capital accumulation Supply-side economics Day care Tax resistance Jizya Theory of conduct Leasing Article One of the United States Constitution Annuity Anarchism and capitalism School choice Labour economics Make money fast Wal-Mart Immigration to the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act MAME GNU General Public License Free trade Knots Landing Child support Salary cap Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Canadian federal election, 1993 Cooperative Health insurance British Royal Family Arguments for and against drug prohibition Copyright Economy of India 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Labor theory of value Motion picture rating system Inheritance tax Economic rent Barrister PGA Tour United States Postal Service Variable universal life insurance Deflation (economics) Keynesian economics Freeters Real estate bubble Dividend Income tax EastEnders Hyperinflation Karl Rove H-1B visa
