h r block tax preperation course in los angeles ca what would someone make doing this part time deciding on whether or not i should take the course please share your pros and cons on the idea i would not be doing this as a full time job how much would i be able to make working for hr block during tax season part time weekends and evenings what use would there certificate of achievement for the course have outside of their corp thank you hi i work in oklahoma but hopefully my experiance will help you decide first of all during the peak part of the season last third of january to about the middle of february i worked every day pm in the evening and hours on the weekend it was a bit hard on my family after peek ended the hours were cut back to a low of about hours per week they picked up again near the end of the season to about per week since i alerayd have a full time job i worked nights and weekends exclusivly just so you're aware i and everyone else had to sign a non compete clause which stated that when i separate service i could not prepare a tax return for an h r block client for two years within a mile radius of the city limits of the town i worked in thus if i didn't like working for them i can't just go work at a different tax company as mentioned before the job is commission based they gave a small draw approx to an hour against your commission however your actually compensation starts at of the paid return volume and of the optional peace of mind insurance program during last tax season i completed approximately returns and made gross keep in mind i'm in oklahoma which has the lowest cost of living of any area so i would expect the compensation to be higher elsewere besides the completed returns i i also had a number of returns i could not complete because they either walked due to the cost of preparation and or they had already done it with a tax software program and just wanted a second opinion or i refused to complete due to obvious fraud least you think i'm negative though it was a really nice fit for myself i didn't have to worry about issues that might occur if i tried doing tax returns on my own such as liability issues i also didn't have to do marketing and didn't have to invest my own money on expenses when i ran into issues i had not dealt with before ie indian exclusion there were a number of seasoned preparers to consult and advise on how to handle the issue i always tried to give my clients their money worth and because of the little things i did such as advice for the future i was able to get about to sign up for an appointment with me next tax season a year in advance these are clients i won't have to share with the other preparers in my office next year in order to get hired on they'll require you to take a basic income tax class class i've got off coupons i'd be willing to send you also can contact the local office and they should offer you a discount on the class i didn't know this and paid the full price the class has completly changed tis year previously it was on paper and pencil and required about hours outside of class for each instructional hour to complete all the exercies and reviews now however they are advertising little work outside of class time and you'll be learning to prepare the returns on the same computer system you'll use on the job around here the classes start in september we also had interns which were basically college students majoring in accounting who were doing the returns for not only cash but college credit as well they were treated exactly the same as st year preparers including being required to sign the non compete agreement and the same compensation hopefully this helps answer your questions feel free to contact me if you have any follow up
