i am late filing my tax return my wife passed away my wife passed away last year and i want to file a joint return how do i indicate that she is deceased and what about her signiture on the return she is definitely not here to sign the return sounds like she did not give someone else power of attorney on these matters and the two of you were living together or she was in a hospital or nursing home if i am wrong on any of these statements you may not be able to file a joint return however it sounds like you can file a joint return on the top of each page of the return write deceased her name and date of death and i agree that in the signature area write filing as surviving spouse this is the most acceptable language recommended by the irs however i have reviewed tax returns with other wording that was acceptable i assume you are aware that next year you will have to file as single unless you have a qualifying child dependent Taxation in the United States Domestic partnerships in California Tax protester Terri Schiavo Plame affair Marriage Life insurance Royal Assent United Kingdom corporation tax British monarchy Medical prescription OpenDocument Concurrent estate Notary public Kent Hovind Order of Canada Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States Constitution of Ireland Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Tom DeLay Inheritance tax Annuity 401(k) Patent application Pledge of Allegiance Trust (Law) USA Succession to Muhammad Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Probate Perl George W.
