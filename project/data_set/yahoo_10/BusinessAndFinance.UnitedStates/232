married filing separately but denied deduction for my wife why my wife is a nonresident alien with no us income and did not file a return i filed as married filing separately claiming her as an exemption and taking the standard deduction now i got back a letter from the irs that says my standard deduction was rejected because when your filing status is married filing separately and your spouse itemizes deductions you must also itemize information on your tax return indicates that your spouse itemized deductions therefore we used zero as your deduction amount if my wife didn't file a return how could she have itemized deductions should we be worried about identify theft of her ssn how does the irs know from information on your return that my wife itemized that doesn't make any sense the irs representative on the phone wasn't helpful at all and wouldn't clarify what this letter means what should i do i should have mentioned that my wife has foreign income which we didn't want taxed that is why we filed separately from the irs if you file a separate return you can claim the exemption for your spouse only if your spouse had no gross income is not filing a return and was not the dependent of another taxpayer this is true even if the other taxpayer does not actually claim your spouse as a dependent this is also true if your spouse is a nonresident alien i am a u s citizen married to a nonresident alien who has no income from u s sources can i claim an exemption for my spouse on my u s tax return yes if you file a joint return you can claim an exemption for your nonresident alien spouse if you do not file a joint return you can claim an exemption for your nonresident alien spouse only if your spouse has has no income from sources within the united states and is not the dependent of another u s taxpayer responding to the comment from bostonianinmo my wife does have a valid ssn from the time she was a student in the us now i'm worried that since she hasn't used the number in many years someone else may have adopted it as their own i think you have more accurate information than the previous answers as you note you are allowed an exemption for your nonresident alien spouse on a mfs return even the irs is not questioning that fact the letter says that your return has information that your spouse itemizes that confuses me but may be the best approximation available in the computer generated letters if your nonresident alien spouse did file a return she would not be allowed the standard deduction i am guessing that the irs is assuming she has or will file a tax return taking itemized deductions and forcing your return to take itemized deductions i would write back explaining what you already know i would include a statement maybe notarized and signed by your spouse that your spouse had no us source income and did not file a return if you can provide a copy of the ss card or other document with her ss number that might help the irs sort things out if the ssn has become attached to another return your other course of action is just to go ahead and itemize taking your state taxes etc your standard deduction was only anyway it
