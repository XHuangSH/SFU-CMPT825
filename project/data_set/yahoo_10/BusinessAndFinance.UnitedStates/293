is taking the tax course a good idea for a nineteen year old entrepreneur i have a life health license too this depends on your personal goals i did something similar i took the tax course from the nation's premier tax preparation firm and worked a season in their offices doing tax returns this is probably the major advantage the ability to do this very profitable work seasonally or be able to work independently as a tax consultant i went further and got 'e file authorized' with the irs so that i could do electronic filing on my own as well as offer the bank loan products rapid refunds etc and feel that i was personally helping my clients rather than being an agent of someone else's glory anyway when i later went to work as a financial adviser and acquired the l h licenses it was not hard to see that almost all of our financial transactions and interactions have tax implications with your l h licenses if you plan to continue in financial services the pressure is on to continue with the investment products or obviously you won't be able to sell the variable contracts or investment related products variable life included taking the series and or and are obviously your next steps if you want to continue or advance in the financial services industry but then you're and entrepreneur this means to me that you are looking for ways to make money from you individual efforts and tend to prefer to work in a business of your own rather than on someone's payroll where you go from here only you can decide but i think you are already on the track to putting together a package of portable marketable skills that will help you in any business these skills will help you to maintain an air of independence and give you the flexibility to keep yourself occupied at a good income level my advice go ahead and take the tax course it's inexpensive and you'll have it under your belt if your later goals point you further along this path you're in charge Insurance Life insurance FairTax Bank Microeconomics Investment bank United Kingdom corporation tax Primerica Financial Services Tax Annuity 401(k) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Monetary policy Progressive tax Economy of Russia Mutual fund Taxation in the United States Gross domestic product Bretton Woods system Islamic banking Security (finance) Privatization Microcredit Mergers and acquisitions Credit card Citigroup Capitalism Inflation Flat tax Strategic management Free trade Economy of the United States Wal-Mart Publicly funded medicine Corporation United States Postal Service Institutional fund management Enterprise content management Corporate finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Stock Theory of the firm Public good Tesco Warren Buffett Economic inequality Airline Capital accumulation Wells Fargo Hedge fund Financial services Real estate broker Labor-power Bank fraud Supply and demand Surplus value Finance Productive and unproductive labour Economy of India Price discrimination Economic relations of Japan Deflation (economics) Salary cap Free market Enron Corporation Gold standard Personal finance Social Security (United States) Toronto-Dominion Bank Corporate governance Customer relationship management Economy of Pakistan Supply-side economics Venture capital Economic history of Japan Mortgage Business Goldman Sachs BAE Systems Coalition Provisional Authority Open source culture Value added tax Prices of production Expert system Kyoto Protocol Copyleft MUMPS Social Security debate (United States) Health insurance Derivative (finance) Management information system
