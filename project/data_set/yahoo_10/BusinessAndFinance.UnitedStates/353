co borrowed on mortgage other borrower in higher tax bracket how to make sure he takes of deduction my boyfriend and i just bought a condo we co borrowed on the mortgage we'll be filing taxes separately he's in a higher tax bracket so it would make sense for him to take the entire mortgage interest deduction since he will get more back than i would how do we make sure that can happen i have heard different things about what we should do for example i have heard that the paper trail for the mortgage payment should always be traceable back to him and him alone e g the checks should come from an account that only has his name attached to it i have also heard that we can take that route but that i can actually pay the principal amount out of my funds so long as he pays the interest amount out of his funds and i have heard that we don't have to go through any of this trouble that as long we don't both try to take the entire interest deduction it's fine however we split it does anyone know for sure is there a source with a definitive answer if you're both on the loan you can split it any way you wish if his ssn is on the form from the mortgage company no further action on either of your parts is required if you are splitting the payments give him your share and let him cut the check for the payment Taxation in the United States Student loan 401(k) Bond Life insurance Flat tax Insurance Mutual fund Bank FairTax Security (finance) Credit card United Kingdom corporation tax Savings and loan association Islamic banking Mortgage-backed security Debt Money Tax Microeconomics Supply-side economics Deflation (economics) Subsidy Primerica Financial Services Income tax Social Security (United States) Bretton Woods system Natural deduction Federal National Mortgage Association Collateralized mortgage obligation Income trust Financial markets Government National Mortgage Association Health insurance Gold standard Personal finance Short selling Public transport Municipal bond Surplus value Tax deduction Capital accumulation Interest Predatory lending Tertiary education fees in Australia Donald Trump Publicly funded medicine Annual percentage rate Treasury security Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Economy of India Mergers and acquisitions Social Security debate (United States) Bank fraud Citigroup Gross domestic product Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Stock Food Stamp Program Concurrent estate Finance Productive and unproductive labour Corporation Logic Tax Reform Act of 1986 Monetary policy Surveillance Federal Reserve Real estate bubble Payroll Money supply Deficit spending Charles Ponzi Fiat money Economy of the United States Toll road Progressive tax Variable universal life insurance Child support Securitization Ponzi scheme Advance fee fraud Registered Retirement Savings Plan Cheque Housing cooperative Cost of capital Interest rate Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Microcredit Operating surplus Tax resistance Dividend Tax bracket
