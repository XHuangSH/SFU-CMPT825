unemployment and w im collecting unemployment and a real estate company wants me to fill out a w form to cut grass for them will that effect my unemployment im goin to claim what i make with them but will it show up like a full time job or not because it is goin to be like a one time thing should i go ahead and do it or pass they're asking for you address and tax identification number since you're not a business with a separate tin that would be your social security number the reason for this is so that they can send you a at the end of the year if you make less than chances are you won't receive one but that would be up to them as for how it affects unemployment it won't show up as a full time job the real estate company does not have to report to the irs payments to contractors you unless they pay or more then they do so by and then only at the end of the year that won't involve the agency in your state responsible for unemployment when you earn money while receiving unemployment benefits they just reduce the amount they pay you for the week in which you earned money elsewhere my benefit rate is per week and when i earned for a day's work they reduced my benefit for that week to personally i thought they'd take the full and was pretty happy that they didn't lol i suppose some states would reduce your benefit by the full amount earned elsewhere but mass doesn't any longer take the money at the very least it will extend the amount of time you can receive uemployment since you have a fixed total amount you can receive Unemployment benefit Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Insurance Microeconomics Unemployment Minimum wage Tax Flat tax Life insurance Keynesian economics FairTax Health insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Gross domestic product Capitalism Inflation Reaganomics National Insurance Labour economics Mutual fund Annuity Deflation (economics) 401(k) Bond Public transport Social Security debate (United States) Compensation of employees Capital accumulation Inheritance tax Variable universal life insurance Credit card Israeli Arab Labor theory of value Surplus value Debt Mortgage Opportunity cost Trade union Economy of the United States Economic inequality Tax cut Bank fraud Wal-Mart Deficit spending Kyoto Protocol Income trust United States Postal Service Ponzi scheme Poker jargon Monetary policy Welfare trap Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Progressive tax Warren Buffett Divorce New Deal Primerica Financial Services Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Technocratic movement Law of value Surveillance Economic history of the United States Baccarat Income Real estate broker Gold standard Slot machine Daylight saving time Efficiency wages Personal finance Public good Make money fast Centrelink Politics of Canada Plame affair Great Depression in the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher Food Stamp Program Betting (poker) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Blackjack Bretton Woods system Trust (Law) USA Say's law U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Hartz concept Corporation
