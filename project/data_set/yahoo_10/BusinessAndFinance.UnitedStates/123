i am curious as to what to do i just started working and i am told i will be paid in the form of a check for for hours and then the rest would be cash is this tax evasion he said that i would be tax free on the rest of the hours i am paid i am really suspicious of this i dont want to get in any trouble what can i do i can show you some cases with revenue that shows such similar instances that such payments may be considered under the table payments now let us say for example in this case we do not know the entire situation so can we automatically assume that it is tax evasion certainly not if the employer is to claim it as wages paid pay the social security and medicare taxes on it etc and otherwise then of course it would not be so under such cases but which employer will do this i want to find them myself many employers for example will pay the taxes on bonuses for example this is not totally unheard of is it a bonus i mean the employer may choose to pay the taxes on the wages being paid of course flsa federal fair labor standards act indicates this one you must pay the employee overtime if they work more than hours in a day period of time this does even apply to people who are considered salaried employees should check with your state of course to see if such application does apply as with all applications easily done by referring such matters to the department of labor or department of labor and industry or by other known names they may wish to refer to it as as an accountant and one who does provide payroll services i will say that i do not believe such situations are always to be considered automatic tax evasion as for example they are going to pay the taxes on the wages received again this is highly unlikely but not unheard of looking to your statement it seems to me to be slightly curious of course and i would have to agree based on what i know of course that yes this is such a case many do go unreported by the way as people do not want to lose their jobs for example and many employers get away with it take walmart for example up until some time ago they were not paying overtime for instance and now they more or less do not even let you work overtime according to some sources i have spoken with i would say you should do what you should think is right for whatever situation but if you are working overtime you should be getting paid that overtime rate as most good employers decent employers and i know both kinds good and not so good respectable ones will follow the laws or the advice of their accounting or payroll staff personally i would drop such a client if they were not and were paying people under the table but then again we are a respectable firm there are exceptions to every rule though and some cases do not require payment of overtime but i doubt they would apply to you but i will not assume they won't overall in our opinion yes it does sound suspicious but as i stated it may very well be legit i suppose you will know if you see the amount on your check as to what you should do it remains in your hands of course but it is something best resolved with the department of labor if that is so it will probably end up in the end with your losing the job and will the state or otherwise pursue charges i never assume anything with these folks wayne barney president bc business services inc Social Security (United States) Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Minimum wage Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Wal-Mart Flat tax United Kingdom corporation tax Publicly funded medicine Plame affair Child support Unemployment benefit United States Postal Service Compensation of employees Annuity Salary Salary cap Insurance Payroll Unemployment Credit card Keynesian economics Health insurance Social Security debate (United States) Overtime Economy of the United States Working time Labour economics Trade union Immigration to the United States National Insurance Article One of the United States Constitution New Deal United States labor law Labor theory of value Inflation Supply and demand Anarchism and capitalism Fair Labor Standards Act Pension Outsourcing Economic inequality H-1B visa Daylight saving time Student loan George W.
