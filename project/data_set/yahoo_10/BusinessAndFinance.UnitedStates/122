please explain the logic and legality of employer deducting tips from my paycheck lets say i do a haircut that cost the customer uses a credit card to pay they add as a tip it is rung thru the is now technically in the cash drawer i take out from the drawer as my tip when i get paid the paystub shows deducted from my pay how is this legal regis corp salons supercuts mastercuts hairmasters etc and other chain salons all do it then on top of that i must claim my tips and am taxed on them at the end of the year i don't get how this is legal please someone tell me how this could be right and if not who do i go to to file a greivance or lawsuit please don't stop giving a tip to a stylist for good service just give it to them in cash then it does not get taken away from us and we don't need to declare it cash cash cash i understand about taxing the tips yes they should be reported as income my problem here is that the company takes the tips out of my paycheck i never even get that money then at the end of the year it is reported as income and i am taxed on it even though it was taken out of my check i don't care about paying the taxes i would do it anyway the issue here is that the company takes the tips out of my check i get the cash on the day of the service but on my check it is taken back out so technically i borrowed the money that is mine to begin with and then they take it back regis corp is absolutely criminal i only go to privately owned salons i don't care if any regis owned salon is giving away haircuts i would never do anything to support their business they are total liars too they claim they don't own great clips or sports clips but look their hqs up online they are all the same address in minneapolis you can ask your boss if great clips is regis they will look you in the face and lie and tell you no hairstylists are like slave workers today it is no longer a glamorous or elite profession how do you want your hair cut ya want fries with that i would contact a lawyer it may be worth your while to file a lawsuit for recompensation as well as a hefty damages amount and to the rest of you out there tip in cash only United Kingdom corporation tax Wal-Mart Insurance FairTax Tax Credit card Taxation in the United States Life insurance United States Postal Service Money Health insurance National Kidney Foundation Singapore Bank fraud Bond Child support Flat tax Capital accumulation Microeconomics Haircut Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of the United States Outsourcing Personal finance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Annuity SCO-Linux controversies Bank Minimum wage Citigroup Mortgage Capitalism Internet fraud Surveillance EFTPOS Warren Buffett Slot machine Price discrimination Enron Corporation Apple Computer Dividend Phishing Identity theft Windows XP Income Mikhail Khodorkovsky U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Inflation Food Stamp Program Poker jargon The Amazing Race Octopus card Cash register Plame affair Hillary Rodham Clinton Make money fast Drug test 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Advance fee fraud Social Security debate (United States) Progressive tax Surplus value Ocean's Twelve 401(k) Blackjack Karl Rove Expert system Filling station Productive and unproductive labour Oil-for-Food Programme Year 2000 problem Publicly funded medicine Education in the United States $ale of the Century Economy of Russia Income tax Sears Holdings Corporation Strategic management National Insurance Tax protester Grand Theft Auto III IBM Gross domestic product Tip System/36 IPod Betting (poker) Babylonian law Corporation Exchange value Mutual fund Electronic commerce Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Lloyd's of London
