what is interim tax we just bought a house new construction but we didn't build it was a spec house in at settlement we were notified that we'll be getting an interim tax bill in the mail they estimated it to be about this is separate from our taxes that are escrowed with our mortgage we were never aware of this before settlement and are really confused about it is it taxes on the house before we owned it if so why are we paying for it if we didn't even know about the house or put an offer in on it then please help clarify this for me we do have our taxes escrowed but the settlement rep said this is separate and we need to pay it up front ijust don't understand why we have to pay taxes on the lot house when we just bought it at the end of july shouldn't the builders pay that i believe that this is the property tax based on the new assessment once the construction was completed the prior taxes you paid were based on the assessment on just the lot this is common with new construction and someone should have informed you however not all sales people are honest Mortgage FairTax Property tax Advance fee fraud Security (finance) Donald Trump Life insurance Mobile home United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the United States Tennessee State Constitution Beverly Hills, California Monopoly (game) British House of Commons Citigroup Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Construction Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Unreformed House of Commons Plame affair Real estate broker Treasury security Allodial title Supply and demand Microeconomics Insurance Wal-Mart Leasing Tax Jean Schmidt Social Security (United States) Tom Brinkman Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Warren Buffett Municipal bond Primerica Financial Services Canadian Senate Estoppel Killington, Vermont California Proposition 13 (1978) Article One of the United States Constitution Contract with America Advertising 401(k) Stamp duty Capital accumulation Personal property Bond Easement Airline Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Tax resistance History of the United States (1918-1945) 2004 Democratic National Convention Dividend Pacific, Missouri Domesday Book Housing cooperative Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Intellectual property Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Personal finance Tom DeLay Public good Self Portrait Oil-for-Food Programme Contract Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania Redundant array of independent disks Wayne Corporation Ponzi scheme Temasek Holdings Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Surplus value Mutual fund Major League Baseball television contracts Capital gains tax Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Income trust Economy of India Country house Karl Rove Canadian House of Commons Real estate bubble Income tax Continuation War Joseph C.
