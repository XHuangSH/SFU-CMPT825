how does doing independent contractor work factor into my unemployment benefits my position was recently eliminated i am deciding whether to request unemployment benefits for just a little bit until my next job i have many student loans and in order to keep up with the payments on these i would work various small jobs on the weekends in which i was paid via check but it was for different companies and always way under so nothing was ever reported this income was not taken into account in determining what weekly unemployment benefits i would receive if i continue to work these contract jobs will i have to report them and have them deducted from my unemployment benefits i will report them at the end of the year on my taxes but how will the unemployment agency find out about them they do not prohibit my typical employment of as they are on the weekends and how will the unemployment agency be able to determine the exact dates that i worked a couple weekends if the agencies most likely won't even report this income please help thanks i said my original position was eliminated i had a regular full time salary job i am not avoiding taxes at all i said i was going to be paying them in i am saying that since my independent contractor work has been going on for awhile in order to pay for my student loans and since the unemployment office doesn't take this into account in order to determine my unemployment benefits i already know i qualify based on my regular salary do i have to report it to the unemployment office it's only about every other week and i'd only be on unemployment weeks max again i already said i would obviously be paying taxes on all the work come april as i did last year i know that independent contractors are totally away from the unemployment system i was a full time regular employee for years before this on the side i also did some independent contracting work that was never reported on behalf of those employers to the state but i reported it on behalf of tax purposes and was taxed on it every april however i am wondering when i receive my unemployment benefits from my seven years of salaried work will my random independent contracting work need to be reported to the unemployment agency as i have always needed this work to continue to pay for past student loans and living expenses in the past and still do now as i was just laid off i will still pay taxes on this come next april i just want to know if i have to report it to the unemployment agency thanks so much ok thanks so much for the last answer i wasn't trying to get away with anything just wondering if it's considered separate by the unemployment agency also what is reported on a thanks again ok i realize that now i was just wondering and didn't know thanks to everyone who answered i just realized that i believe i won't be eligible for unemployment benefits though because of what my employer has entered into my k plan he fully contributed of my income every year and i think according to my state that this constitutes a deduction as far as to the benefits i can receive and what my employer contributed to my k right now pre tax and penalties outweighs my maximum unemployment benefits does this make sense or sound right state law determines unemployment benefits but generally an independent contractor does not pay into the unemployment system therefore your benefits will only be calculated on the work in which you were the employee of someone who paid unemployment insurance for you Social Security (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 401(k) United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Insurance National Insurance Annuity Unemployment Tax Student loan Flat tax Compensation of employees Health insurance FairTax Wal-Mart Pension Minimum wage Centrelink Payroll Child support Salary cap Gross domestic product Microeconomics Professor Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Health savings account Article One of the United States Constitution Credit card Social Security debate (United States) Capitalism National Football League Mortgage Employment Education in the People's Republic of China Variable universal life insurance Contract Trade union United States Postal Service Primerica Financial Services Income tax Publicly funded medicine Welfare trap Graduate school Hartz concept Labour economics ITV Canadian House of Commons George W.
