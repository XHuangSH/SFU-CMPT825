what tax for a uk share when i reside in the usa i inherited a soccer share from the uk years ago it is now worth x it's value from when i received it am i right in saying i would pay us capital gains tax of colorado from the increase when i file my tax for it does it make more likely to be audited i don't know for sure what value the share was yrs ago when you receive assets in an estate the basis or cost of the asset is set equal to the value at the time you inherited it so it's probably worth your while to estimate the value of the shares if it's publicly traded the price may be available on yahoo on the uk site i give an example link for hsbc below if you are a us citizen you should pay a long term capital gains rate of federal however your federal rate may be higher if you are subject to the dreaded alternative minimum tax amt it could be as high as in colorado unless the investment qualifies for an exemption which i don't think it does you will also need to pay colorado state tax in terms of audits the irs will see the price you sell it at you should match that on your return your basis will be quite low so there really isn't that much money for them to quibble over if you show a low basis however you can never tell with the irs it just doesn't sound like an audit item that you should be afraid of is you report honestly good luck Taxation in the United States Tax FairTax Mutual fund United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Inheritance tax Flat tax 401(k) Life insurance Deflation (economics) Bond Capital gains tax Gross domestic product Variable universal life insurance Capital accumulation Hedge fund Surplus value Progressive tax Capitalism Supply-side economics Wal-Mart Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Minimum wage Warren Buffett Mortgage Inflation Economy of Russia Corporation Income trust Publicly funded medicine Labor theory of value Tax haven Economy of India Bank Arthur Laffer Social Security (United States) Corporate finance Hyperinflation Monetary policy Tax protester Stock Debt Islamic banking Privatization Offshore bank Arbitrage Tariff Ra (board game) Tom DeLay Health insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economics Security (finance) Employee stock option Keynesian economics Divorce Economic rent Finance PE ratio Gold standard Rational pricing Property tax Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Church of Scientology Wealth condensation Municipal bond Productive and unproductive labour Donald Trump Income tax Gold as an investment Fractional-reserve banking Agricultural policy Salary cap Student loan Galactic Civilizations Intellectual property Economy of the United States Trust (Law) USA Individual Savings Account Education in the United States Citigroup Supply and demand H-1B visa Bretton Woods system SCO-Linux controversies ELO rating system Article One of the United States Constitution Temasek Holdings Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Derivative (finance)
