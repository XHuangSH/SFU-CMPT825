what would happen if the us went back on a gold standard and suppose the irs was abolished separate questions a for starters a new national economic equilibrium would need to be established which would for lack of better words be bad how lets say that hypothetically one ounce of gold equals one us dollar lets also say that this standard is established right now this very moment well taking into consideration the govt setting gold standards for every dollar issued and knowing the value of the us dollar value being what is backed by promise of the federal government as guarantee of repayment for goods and services and being that the dollar has no real or intrinsic value then two problems would arise the first being if every dollar in circulation was set against a gold standard backed by the federal govt inevitably massive inflation would take place as the amount of dollars required to make purchases would escalate through the roof why well think of it this way the government is in all reality a publicly traded company who issues stock in the form of currency like the value of any stock a stocks price is not based on what it is worth now rather it is presently valued to its projected potential or future value currency in the gold standard would be like having to buy stock in a company at its present value with conditions of solvency meaning that if its stock were sold today or tomorrow or whenever then every share of stock you had received bought would be entitled to an equivalent proportion of the historical equity share of the stock that was purchased this would work out relatively fine if you only bought into companies that were not in or ever were going to be in debt the government however is in debt and with a gold standard established we would see the per share value dollar buying power of the us 's stock currency fall as the government's debt increased this weakening of the buying power would initiate inflation why would this happen because the government under gold standards would still issue dollars be responsible for redemption of dollars and ultimately the most important factor be responsible for responsible fiscal budgeting as not to diminish the value of dollars in circulation which they back since a financial product is worth only as much as the company that backs it since the last of these responsibilities would be nearly impossible to perform and in order to compensate for the arising economic dis equilibrium more dollars would continuously be needed to purchase goods and services before we know it a gallon of gas would cost one hundred dollars remember we are talking about a gold standard which would be established through the global laws of supply and demand the only way to protect a standard once established is to preserve the status quo that would require elimination of fiscal deficit growth so what would happen internationally for starters we would begin to export more and more than we import since our dollar is weaker and products and services cost comparably less to other nations here is the contradiction most people don't realize with an increase in net exports which is exports imports comes less sources of domestic investment from foreign nations by way of selling them goods less imports equates to a reduction in industrialized growth when we export we sell a good the proceeds return as capital and then the other nation consumes it when we import we get to consume the good the nation that we bought from receives the capital in american currency then typically invest the american currency back into us firms in other words it is more beneficial to import goods which can be used in the factors of production while at the same time having the foreign nation providing capital for us investment and expansion caused by a deficit in our net exports why all of this net export info it all comes back to the value of the dollar in our hypothetical gold standard scenario when the dollar becomes weak our exports tend to rise as foreign nations spot the opportunity to buy goods at cheaper prices this is called the depreciation of the domestic currency relative to the foreign currency an exchange rate term that coincides directly with net export status either a deficit or surplus with our weaker dollar we tend to import less since goods cost comparatively more net exports surplus but remember when we import more we not only get the product but we also have the buying nation reinvesting their american dollars back into our economy stimulating growth in short as we lose strength in our dollar we end up running into a net export surplus which stifles domestic economic growth which generates less revenue for the government through taxes which causes the federal budget deficit to increase which cause a weakening of the dollar now true the fed can play around with interest rates and loans however their effect is short term nominal and does not effect long term growth conclusion our national fiscal policy has developed into a credit based financial system think of our economic situation as a necessary invention to create things that no amount of gold could have possibly accomplished the reason for our economic growth lies in the reality that a body the fed can print paper give it a number and make people work their whole lives to get more of it to try to limit the value of a currency by assigning it a standard would be back stepping remember america is a company currency is stock and america has tons of assets to say the least so just go along with the game even though we both know money isn't real and enjoy what it has provided b it would get sucked up by walmart
