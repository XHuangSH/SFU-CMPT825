what do you think about taxes america was built on the foundation of being tax free we even threw a tea party over it back in the day now however people have houses taken from them inheritances taxed so greatly they lose everything i knew a farmer who died and left his land to his three sons they had no money and nothing besides the land they worked on all their lives the government came and told them the value of the land for inheritance tax they were unable to pay it and lost everything not every case is as big as this but it is important you realize this happens everyday any working american is taxed losing about of what they make before they even are paid we are a nation with a high poverty level while politicians and government officials live with all the luxeries we need to realize this as a country what does everyone else think jefferson said the government that governs best governs least yes there is a need for some things but we are paying for much more than a clean country and roads to get to work in my opinion there should be no b s takes like inheritance property etc but just enough to keep our great country alive without making politicians rich and the rich near untouchable after hearing a few opinions i think most would agree but i want to hear all your voices not just a few americans but america as a whole and beautiful country i love the land we live in but it is dire need of reform and in more areas than just taxes i never said they taxed it i simply said they could not afford to keep the land their father left them which they worked on all their lives i know them personally and while are still struggling on after this happened years ago one the youngest couldn't live with it anymore the world is not about money but love and family above all else if you can't see that what do you have in your life as for history taxation without representation is exactly what i am talking about you speak for one group but what of the rest of us we certainly don't feel properly represented to answer even more questions and statements the world census is not by far accurate but set at numbers which have to be approved also the level they judge poverty at is also wrong a family must make at least a year to support both parents and children that is bare minimum poverty level is set at about per family or aprox k for each parent look at those numbers and tell me what the real poverty level is most estates do not pay an estate tax since the federal limit is currently we didn't revolt because we wanted to be tax free we revolted because taxes were being passed left and right without any consultation of the persons being taxed i do agree that the current tax system is not fair with all the tax loopholes and gifts to favored donators but right now it's all that we have to work within if someone has a more fair way of taxing please let's hear it Property tax Flat tax Tax U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 FairTax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Parliament of the United Kingdom Separation of church and state United Kingdom corporation tax Life insurance Microeconomics Capitalism Inheritance tax Liberalism Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Annuity Hillary Rodham Clinton Order of succession Democratic Party (United States) Miss Saigon Minimum wage Insurance Plame affair Value added tax Progressive tax Canadian federal election, 1993 Politics of Canada California government and politics Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Rent (musical) Liberal Democrats (UK) Avenue Q Originalism Publicly funded medicine Tom DeLay Article One of the United States Constitution Education in England Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an British House of Commons American Revolution Campaign finance reform Free trade 39th Canadian federal election First Amendment to the United States Constitution Free market Simone Weil Libertarianism Corporate personhood Rick Santorum Bretton Woods system Social Security (United States) Live 8 Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Democracy Allodial title House of Lords Estoppel Ten Commandments Pitaten History of the United States (1789-1849) Corporation United States Federal government of the United States Education in the United States Craps History of the United States Constitution Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Szlachta 2004 Democratic National Convention Agricultural policy One Tree Hill (TV series) Child support Tax protester Unreformed House of Commons American Conservatism Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Socrates Wal-Mart Robert Walpole Mumia Abu-Jamal United States Constitution School choice Primogeniture Economy of the United States Autism rights movement Court system of Canada Past teachings of Prem Rawat Economy of India Canadian and American politics compared 2005 trial of Michael Jackson
