fantasy trade would you accept this trade if you were the other guy i add qb jeff garcia bears d st i lose qb vince young packers d st to be honest with you i think this trade is unfairly lopsided towards you but i think i value jeff garcia a lot higher than most people i also value chi lower than most people but i like them better than young jeff garcia was a great qb when he was running the west coast offense in san fran and even last year in philly his talent is obviously a little less than from both of those teams but i still think he is going to be a stud this year at qb young gets the edge over garcia but not by much and what you lose in that matchup you more than makeup for with chi's d over gb's i am a green bay fan and think their d is going to be pretty good but chicago is obviously better and as i've already said i don't value young much higher than garcia New York Giants NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Green Bay Packers Super Bowl Brett Favre San Francisco 49ers Jerry Garcia Cleveland Browns Minnesota Vikings Oakland Athletics Cincinnati Bengals Oakland Raiders San Francisco Giants NFL playoffs, 2002-03 World Series National Football League Lore Atlanta Falcons Toronto Blue Jays Seattle Mariners NFL playoffs, 1994-95 Super Bowl I National Football League St. Louis Rams Dallas Cowboys Florida Marlins Vince Lombardi Donovan McNabb Utah Jazz St. Louis Cardinals Chicago White Sox September 2005 in sports December 2004 in sports Carolina Panthers Pittsburgh Steelers New York Jets Philadelphia Phillies October 4 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Jeff Garcia October 2005 in sports Pro Football Hall of Fame Cleveland Indians Detroit Lions NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Washington Redskins Jacksonville Jaguars Chicago Bears Super Bowl II Iron Bowl Detroit Tigers Kansas City Chiefs Houston Astros National Basketball Association NFL playoffs, 1990-91 New York Knicks NFL playoffs Chicago Cubs Jeff Kent Los Angeles Dodgers NFL Most Valuable Player Award Continental Basketball Association WWE Vengeance Nickname Boston Bruins Toronto Raptors November 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXXII 2003-04 NHL season Pittsburgh Pirates Jeff Jarrett Super Bowl XXVII Chicago Bulls National Football League championships Los Angeles Kings International League Chicago Blackhawks Sub-Zero Grateful Dead Monday Night Football Scott Hall Jeff George Professional American football championship games November 3 in baseball Philadelphia Flyers Toronto Argonauts 2005 World Series Curt Schilling Wrigley Field Hulk Hogan Super Bowl XXXI National Wrestling Alliance Basketball Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Cincinnati Reds Zorro 2000 Australian Grand Prix Running back November 2 in baseball October 1 in baseball
