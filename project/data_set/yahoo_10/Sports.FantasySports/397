what is the deal with all these trades already the season doesn't start for weeks there's no way to know exactly who will be ok who will be injured etc any of the qbs top rbs and top d etc will be just as good as any other on opening week just stock up with sleeper free agents and wait for people to come calling during the season it's crazy to overthink preseason trades don't you think thank you someone with half a brain i haven't made a football trade since and have made it to at least the championship game in all of my leagues much less trading in the preseason when nothing has happened yet the only reason i would consider trading a guy is if i heard something about a player such as injury that is relatively unknown and hope that other guys haven't heard about it but that is so unlikely keep your players that you draft through at least the first couple of weeks why else would you draft them the idea of the draft isn't to trade away players at least not until a few weeks into the season National Football League New England Patriots Cleveland Browns New York Giants Carolina Panthers Toronto Blue Jays Bernie Kosar Chicago Bulls Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXVII Pittsburgh Steelers St. Louis Rams Donovan McNabb Orlando Magic Dallas Cowboys Terrell Owens Detroit Tigers Oakland Athletics Jacksonville Jaguars Baltimore Ravens Playoff New Jersey Nets New York Jets Boston Red Sox Alex Ferguson Bristol Rugby Qu__bec Nordiques Sammy Sosa Ryan Leaf Indiana Pacers Oakland Raiders Seattle Mariners Kansas City Royals Kansas City Chiefs Minnesota Vikings Arena Football League Super Bowl XXXIV Major League Baseball San Francisco 49ers Houston Rockets Dan Marino Cincinnati Bengals Utah Jazz Tampa Bay Buccaneers Damon Allen Kobe Bryant John Elway Minor league baseball Yao Ming Miami Dolphins Women's National Basketball Association Toronto Raptors Philadelphia Eagles American Football League New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Green Bay Packers Los Angeles Kings San Antonio Spurs Jerry Rice 2004-05 in English football Atlanta Falcons Minnesota Timberwolves Chicago Cubs USC Trojans Football Doug Flutie Poker jargon Football (soccer) Ipswich Town F.C. 1981 baseball strike St. Louis Cardinals Wayne Simien Exhibition game Bryan Robson West Bromwich Albion F.C.
