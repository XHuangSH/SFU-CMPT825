my team only has two dl spots and i have three injured players c young renteria soriano do i cut one or i could keep one on the bench my team gets a lot of rs not a ton of rbis have ortiz byrnes chipper i also have good pitching fausto penny lilly smoltz you have to keep all all of them are some of the best at their position chris young has the lowest era in the majors for a starting pitcher he is having a better year than guys like johan santana pitching is hard to come by so he is a definite keep soriano is going to be out for a while but once again is too good to drop because when he does come back he will have an impact soriano might miss more time than you would think it was revealed today that he has a centimeter tear in his quad a tear is much worse than a strain and can have long lasting effects so who knows maybe he will be out for the rest of the season the estimated time range for his return is weeks to a month but like i said now that they have discovered a tear it could be longer i would hold onto him and see how things play out if it doesn't look like he will come back drop him renteria is good because of his batting average and really his all around hitting skills he is hitting and has runs along with stolen bases so all of those are excellent numbers for a shortstop and he will likely return sooner than later bottom line is you should hold onto all players they are all prime for their position and will have a positive impact on your team good luck 1957 World Series Edgar Renter__a Baseball Batting average 2003 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Alex Rodriguez November 1 in baseball Babe Ruth John Smoltz International League Sandy Koufax World Series 2004 World Series Chicago White Sox Pitcher Cleveland Indians Softball Boston Red Sox Andr__s Galarraga 1919 World Series 2005 World Series Dave Concepci__n Robin Ventura Baseball scorekeeping Hank Aaron Ty Cobb Manny Ram__rez Seattle Mariners Detroit Tigers Tris Speaker Lou Gehrig 1986 World Series Florida Marlins Nolan Ryan Roger Clemens Stolen base David Ortiz 2004 American League Championship Series Cincinnati Reds Baseball Stars Box score (baseball) Atlanta Braves Chipper Jones Luis Aparicio Texas Rangers (baseball) Albert Pujols Alan Trammell Luke Appling Pedro Mart__nez Reggie Jackson Earned run average Designated hitter St. Louis Cardinals October 2005 in sports 2001 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Sammy Sosa Moe Berg Billboard Hot 100 Chicago Cubs Bert Campaneris Herbert Sutcliffe Batting (cricket) No-hitter October 26 in baseball Johan Santana Ichiro Suzuki 1981 baseball strike Torii Hunter New York Yankees New York Giants Pete Rose October 21 in baseball September 20 in baseball Greg Maddux November 4 in baseball Craig Biggio Mike Schmidt Troy Glaus 1975 World Series Chris Amon Ken Griffey, Jr. Gary Sheffield Barry Bonds Hank Greenberg New York Mets Brian Roberts Babe Ruth's Called Shot Cricket November 2 in baseball October 4 in baseball Major League Baseball Fast bowling
