drafts coming up number pick in both leagues i am leaning toward picking steven jackson with the number pick but should i take him second in both leagues or take another player at pick in one league alexander gore or larry johnson are all players i would consider or maybe manning i am not totally sold on jackson but not sure i can trade out ofthe pick thanks if you had the pick in both leagues would you be worried about taking lt both times if a guy is the second best player available then take him i understand that you would want to choose some different players for the two teams but when your first choice is that high of a pick i would feel comfortable going with the same guy in both leagues you can diversify after that definitely do not pick manning as a top selection a qb cannot match the impact of a rb if you personally don't think jackson is your guy then i would recommend gore as your pick alexander is getting old and johnson will not repeat the success he had last year with all the changes around him new qb new lineman San Francisco 49ers New York Knicks Chicago Bulls NBA Draft National Football League New England Patriots New York Giants Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl XXVII Draft (sports) Pittsburgh Steelers Los Angeles Clippers Buffalo Bills NFL Draft Reggie Jackson Qu__bec Nordiques San Antonio Spurs Detroit Red Wings Kansas City Chiefs National Basketball Association Major League Baseball New Mexico Lobo Basketball Boston Bruins Tris Speaker Cleveland Cavaliers New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Pittsburgh Penguins New York Mets Satchel Paige Carolina Panthers Miami Hurricanes Football Montreal Canadiens Cincinnati Bengals Indiana Pacers Jacksonville Jaguars WNBA Draft Larry Bird Randy Johnson Dallas Cowboys Atlanta Flames Toronto Raptors Team Fortress Classic New York Islanders Brian Close Ty Cobb Steve Nash LeBron James Raymond Bourque Denis Law Orlando Magic 1986 NBA Draft Sheepshead World Series Portsmouth F.C.
