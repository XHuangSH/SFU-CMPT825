is this deal fair i give up a ramirez e bedard al reyes tb closer i get miggy cabrera j smoltz my closers are already m rivera b myers soria h street al reyes so is this deal good for me and can i afford to give up al reyes with my current group of closers thanks this is a team h h non keeper league if that info helps thanks dgknsd k thanks for the reply i guess the only concern i have is if i have enough closers to cover the loss of al reyes because all the closers are snatched up in the fa pool dgknsd very good thanks again you get arguably the nd rd best third basemen in the game arod then a tossup between miggy and david wright and you get a great pitcher bedard is doing well for a bad baltimore team with great strikeouts and great peripheral stats however smoltz is more consistent and is not too shabby himself on strikeouts the addition of mark teixeira and dotel will help him get wins as well which helps you out in fantasy tex will get rbi's and dotel a former closer would be a great setup man probably better than wickman reyes was a surprise this year but if you are getting these two you can afford to trade him away try to find some closer on the wire of if you can't find one get a relief pitcher that has great k's whip and era like hideki okajima or pat neshek edit i just read your closers i must have read over them you've got decent good closers mariano is doing well but has not got a lot of saves this year cause of the yankees inability to give him chances in the first half of the year but has been doing much better lately myers did well in the role before getting injured and i do believe he will continue to dominate and soria has shown good things with the way alan embree is pitching street might not close until late august september i still advise you to try to find another closer on the wire or a great relief pitcher in a non keeper league this trade would suit you but in a keeper league what you gave up would be more than you get miggy is a great keeper but smoltz has to regress eventually aram is a young guy who should be doing better in years to come not as well as miggy but you have to accept that tradeoff bedard is a pitcher who has shown flashes of genious in the past but has finally put it together this year and will be or should be one of the top pitchers in the league for years to come al reyes is just filling in until the rays find a good enough player to usurp his throne as closer however this being a non keeper league the trade is in your favor and in a team league the wire should have decent players to replace what you give up in the trade had this been a team league the trade is more intriguing and harder to pull the trigger on as the wire would offer bench players and perhaps a platoon player at best with reliable closers i do believe you can afford to get rid of him having three closers is the norm anyways you had one more than what most fantasy players use it is a good strategy though i tried that out this year and drafted five closers on a few teams i owned saves whip and era and was able to trade the closers i had to a team that didn't for a premium do the trade before he tries to rescind it lol at the thumbs down perhaps you guys should just give a good thorough response instead of do it it's good for you 2004 World Series Babe Ruth Oakland Athletics International League World Series Boston Red Sox 2003 World Series Sandy Koufax Mariano Rivera 1957 World Series Cincinnati Reds New York Giants New York Yankees Roger Clemens Detroit Tigers Florida Marlins Atlanta Braves November 2 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez 1919 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Closer (baseball) New York Mets Chicago Cubs Robin Ventura Houston Astros Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Chicago White Sox San Diego Padres Nolan Ryan October 22 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Baseball statistics Alex Rodriguez Save (sport) St. Louis Cardinals Los Angeles Dodgers 1981 baseball strike October 31 in baseball October 4 in baseball Ty Cobb Andr__s Galarraga Greg Maddux Pitcher Pittsburgh Steelers November 1 in baseball Tris Speaker October 13 in baseball Randy Johnson Leeds United F.C.
