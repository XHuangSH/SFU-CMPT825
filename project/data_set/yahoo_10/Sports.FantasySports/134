which rb matches best with laurence maroney as a second pick i'm in a team draft with eyes on maroney for my first pick his bye week is i've run numerous practice drafts and have the following options for my second pick overall which rb is the best match and why travis henry bye week maurice jones drew thomas jones willis mcgahee brandon jacobs ronnie brown cedric benson or should i go with tom brady carson palmer chad johnson marvin harrison steve smith torry holt i'll weigh in on this as it is a good question picks on the turn are tough i think travis henry is a good fit for you maroney has huge upside but comes with significant injury risk if he doesn't pan out as your stud you'll wish you had another top back to carry your team henry was brought in to be the feature back the bell boys couldn't get it down last year so shanahan wants a guy who can slam between the tackles and score feature backs are few and far between people forget that denver's terrell davis was a fantasy machine before marshall faulk and priest holmes a henry was getting it done last year behind a weak line and a rookie qb denver's o line and downfield blocking are significantly better daniel graham is a devastating blocker henry is a good pass catcher as well denver backs are a guaranteed yards and i have to believe the tds will come in bunches taking a qb at won't kill your team but will have the effect of making your wr and rb very weak afterall good qbs are still around in the third and fourth rounds you would settle for bulger wouldn't you a top wideout is not a bad play at harrison johnson smith and holt are excellent choices but again your rb is going to be really poor you may be lucky to get an ahman green caliber back in the third the other backs you are considering have more question marks durability platoons new teams new to the starting role if you pass on wr you still can get a donald driver for your wr and a marc bulger or risk at donovan mcnabb for qb if all the qbs go so what take phillips rivers and jay cutler later and play flavor of the week i do like mjd so he's not a bad choice either any back that catches the ball is a bonus in my mind henry's only risk is his place on the prior offender list for substance abuse and he's regular battle with turf toe he was fine on both counts last year so unless he burns lettuce on his off days i think he's good to go Running back Pittsburgh Steelers NFL playoffs, 2004-05 NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXXVI Buffalo Bills National Football League Lore St. Louis Rams October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXVII Cincinnati Bengals San Francisco 49ers National Football League Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXI Carolina Panthers New York Jets Kansas City Chiefs NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Toronto Raptors Glossary of American football Super Bowl XXXIII United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics December 2004 in sports Wide receiver 1957 World Series Super Bowl V Indiana Pacers Jerry Rice NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXVI Dallas Cowboys Volleyball Indianapolis Colts New York Knicks Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXXIX Stage name Randy Moss Cris Carter Super Bowl XXXVIII Miami Dolphins 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Denver Broncos Rugby union Toronto Blue Jays American football Super Bowl XIV Indianapolis 500 Super Bowl XIII English cricket team 1986 NBA Draft Super Bowl XXII American football strategy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 2005 Pro Bowl Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXXII Poker jargon Chicago Bulls Satchel Paige Wahoo McDaniel Montreal Canadiens Fifty-seventh United States Congress Brian Close Kurt Warner Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Manitoba general election, 1922 Football Seventy-fifth United States Congress January 2005 in sports Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXV Michael Jordan Playoff Professional wrestling throws Academy Award for Best Art Direction Detroit Tigers Fast bowling International League NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Sunday Times Rich List 2004 Baseball Houston Rockets Sixty-first United States Congress Seventy-sixth United States Congress Detroit Red Wings
