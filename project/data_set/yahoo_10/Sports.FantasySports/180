julius jones jj said that he was running like a robot and you could obviously see that when he would run into the pile when there was a huge lane to run through outside he has dropped a few pounds buffed up and looks a lot quicker than last year what do u think he will do this year btw he says he will be unleashed what do u think i think he is at best in any ff league a back up running back barber is and is going to start being the man out in dal country they say jones will get unleashed but for how long barber proved himself last year to be able to score when they needed it and able to carry the load i had jj on my team last year and i must say it sucked he might run for yards in one game and get nowhere near the end zone last year it got like pts or something if i needed a bye week running back i might think about getting him other than that he is in the fa pool in all my leagues and if he isn't he tends to be a th stringer you can take the chance and hopefully it works out out in the fa pool are probably guys like norwood foster bell even jackson in gb they say right now all of them are going to be the starters and will be the only back the only place i see being problems are foster and bell but i wouldn't worry much about it at this point i would rather have norwood than jones right now if you want take jj and see what happens but as a smart ff move its not that great good luck New York Giants NFL playoffs, 1990-91 Pittsburgh Steelers 1957 World Series Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXVI NFL playoffs, 1991-92 Super Bowl XXV American football Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXXVIII 2000 Australian Grand Prix National Football League Canadian football NFL playoffs, 1995-96 NFL playoffs, 1981-82 NFL playoffs, 1996-97 NFL playoffs, 1992-93 Glossary of American football National Football League Lore San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XIII 2005 World Series Super Bowl XXI Extreme Programming NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 Super Bowl XVIII The Contender (television series) Super Bowl IX New England Patriots 1919 World Series Super Bowl XXXVI NFL playoffs, 2002-03 NFL playoffs, 1989-90 Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXXIV Rugby league Super Bowl XXXV Satchel Paige Babe Ruth NFL playoffs, 1993-94 Piccolo Junior Saga Playoff format New York Jets Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl V Kansas City Chiefs Newcastle United F.C.
