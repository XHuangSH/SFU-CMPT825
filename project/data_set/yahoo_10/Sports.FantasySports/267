is this a good ff trade i give him tom brady and brandon jackson and i get willie parker and marion barber iii i also have payton jake delhomme but my running deanglo williams and vernand morency my wr are steve smith javon walker darrell jackson i have gates and the chargers d and nate k just let me know what you think about the trade because i need a good rb you win by a landslide in this trade willie parker is a top back and thus a top player and the player of closest comparison is tom brady brady is a good qb but i would not lose sleep over losing him the difference between a qb you can get in rounds and vs rounds and is not close to the difference between rbs in this range that is the sole reason that rbs are picked before qbs i would be very surprised if this trade gets accepted who else does he have at rb that he is willing to trade these players away by payton do you mean you have peyton manning i am a bit surprised that you would draft him and brady actually either of them period but i guess that would make sense considering the rest of your team my advice would be in your next draft s do not draft with the intention of trading it never works out as it should this is merely because other people are drafting to fill their needs independent of trades they may make someone who sees that you have that depth at qb automatically gets a leg up on the deal because you need to get rid of the qb to cash in on his value as you can't play two i think if you are the one offering the trade i assume so that you need to be a little more realistic try offering brady for say cedric benson straight up good luck brother New York Giants Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXXVIII Toronto Raptors Chicago Bulls Pittsburgh Steelers NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXVII San Francisco 49ers Carolina Panthers New York Knicks Running back Minnesota Timberwolves 1986 NBA Draft New York Mets Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XXXVI NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Satchel Paige Walter Payton Days of our Lives Gary Payton (basketball) Orlando Magic Cleveland Cavaliers Wheel of Fortune December 2004 in sports $ale of the Century Eli Manning Los Angeles Kings Cincinnati Bengals Detroit Red Wings Norway national football team Poker jargon San Antonio Spurs Los Angeles Clippers Cleveland Browns Celtic F.C.
