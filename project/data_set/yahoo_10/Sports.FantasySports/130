how is my fantasy football team qb donovan mcnabb backup philip rivers wr marvin harrison lee evans deion branch backups kevin curtis isaac bruce rb larry johnson travis henry backup cedric benson te kellen winslow backup l j smith k josh brown def minnesota backup seattle most detailed answer will get best answer rock solid qb mcnabb has the most upside you probably got him in the th round but is injury prone and rivers is a solid back up with your rb depth you may have to trade one with rivers for a stud qb if mcnabb goes down long term rb looks like your st and nd rd picks and you did very well and getting benson later gives you a solid backup i would carry another rb and not carry defenses unless you have a strange scoring system rb's are gold not defenses and benson is an injury risk and johnson is a hold out risk i think you can get either of those defenses on waivers wr solid with no depth you can't count on curtis or bruce if you have any injuries i'd watch the waiver wires closely to upgrade in one or both of those spots te rock solid and with both injury prone you need to carry k good def not good but not that important you can play waivers with match ups each week if you want but no reason to carry these defenses add to your rb depth overall you have a shot to win your league and are a lock to make the playoffs Pittsburgh Steelers Miami Dolphins Cincinnati Bengals Buffalo Bills San Francisco 49ers Carolina Panthers New England Patriots Donovan McNabb NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Indiana Pacers September 2005 in sports New York Giants Philadelphia Eagles January 2005 in sports New York Jets National Football League NFL playoffs, 2003-04 New York Knicks Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXXIV National Football League Lore Los Angeles Clippers 1986 NBA Draft Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl XXXIX Indianapolis Colts Baltimore Ravens Detroit Red Wings San Diego Chargers Super Bowl XXI Dallas Cowboys Minnesota Timberwolves New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets The Great American Bash Manny Legace Super Bowl XXII October 2005 in sports Minnesota Vikings Clash of Champions Toronto Raptors Seattle Mariners NBA Finals Major League Baseball television contracts Toronto Argonauts Toronto Blue Jays Madden NFL Super Bowl XXXVI Terrell Owens United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics St. Louis Rams Chicago Bulls Running back American football Sixty-sixth United States Congress Cris Carter Australian rules football StarrCade Super Bowl VII New Orleans Saints Steve Nash Baseball Stage name Atlanta Falcons Playoff December 2004 in sports Detroit Tigers Super Bowl IX Survivor Series Super Bowl XXXVIII Crystal Palace F.C.
