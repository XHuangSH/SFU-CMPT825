yahoo answers fantasy football pet peeve i'm grumpy so i am ranting today don't you love questions like this rate my team qb peyton manning carson palmer rb tomlinson steven jackson brian westbrook wr steve smith marvin harrison chad johnson larry fitzgerald te antonio gates def chicago baltimore k jeff wilkins what would you do to improve this team please help me lame feel free to use your answer as a place to complain best complaint gets points ah i feel better already you guys are great i see in your futures some mysterious thumbs up appearing on your previosu best answers ya know its kind of interesting just because there is actually a better team you could make ahaha well in theory but honestly wtf is up with these people ya know its not actually the people who have the good teams that piss me off the people who have the good drafts and pick the good players those ones i don't mind its actually when those idiots think of picking a peterson in the rd round and hoping he has some mircale season those idiots who think that taking the entire football team bills in one of my leagues who piss me off when they ask is my team good rate those people deserve the most to be thrown out also the people who want better players in any fantasy sport but give us the person they wanna trade peavy for example and then don't give us the rest of their team or anything its just a flippin player we can only guess then those same people get mad at us because we suggest that they trade for somebody on their own team also our top leader you have got to be kidding me lets go on a rant shall we i admit i have answered some of those questions but its usually because its just join my league and then there is nothing after it this guy is only there because everybody seems to follow the white rabbit nobody ever hears him pick answer ask questions or anything that guy just answers those stupid questions and is in enough leagues well personally i am in football leagues a football pick um and a salary cap league and i want more i love my fantasy football the people who actually try here in these fantasy sports should be able to pick the top people if i had my way i would easily boot schyly or whatever it is off the top i can't predict the top but i know he wouldn't be there then there is when i ask questions wow i thank you crash baseball and fantasy for actually answering my damn best answer question about people here other than that i hate those word answer lazy stupid crazy all of that its worthless when you ask a question you expect an actual answer i got one and i gave my points don't get me going on voting for best answer instead of chosing one what hits me harder is when you put a huge amount of thought into an answer and then a person who puts a football team gets the best answer wtf is up with that screw that and everything else when you answer a question in fantasy sports more than likely that question won't be answered or voted on for best answer it sucks i just want an actual fair best answer selection and i give your team a your qb rb wr te def k are great but instead of fitzgerald i would take holt then it would be a ahahaha good luck edit sorry about the long complaint list i could just keep going if i needed to but i'm sure nobody wants to read this much crap ok one last gripe i answered this question about starting clark over shockey read it he choose the guy who had a line answer i'm surprised he didn't pick the guy who said shockey what a dumbass if you want a one word answer just ask for it New York Giants National Football
