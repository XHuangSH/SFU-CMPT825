will eric moulds be reciver for vince young i need to know bc the projected reciver in available in my fantasy league my qb is vince young he probably won't be the number but he will get most of the balls there is a big debate going on about this and honestly i think he is going to be the number with jones being as young as he is its really hard for a young qb to count on a guy like that vince is going to find moulds more often than not just because he is the veteran most likely moulds will put up pretty good starts for a rd receiver on a team i wouldn't draft him though he honestly right now isn't worth that draft pick vince will end up having more trust in a guy like moulds who has been around the block a couple times and has seen many different qb's even though he had a bad year last year expect moulds to come out of his shell on the other note look for jones to have a big year as well with moulds teaching him his stats should continue to go up as the year goes i wouldn't draft moulds but i would probably pick him up after the draft is done good luck Toronto Raptors Pittsburgh Steelers San Francisco 49ers New York Giants New York Knicks National Football League Super Bowl XXVII Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XIV Carolina Panthers 2000 Australian Grand Prix Norway national football team 1957 World Series New England Patriots Vince Carter Washington Redskins Sheepshead Detroit Red Wings St. Louis Rams Chicago White Sox Atlanta Flames Piccolo Junior Saga Oakland Raiders Super Bowl Eric Bischoff Paul Levesque Steve Nash Brian Close Mark Calaway Draft (sports) Yao Ming Winning Streak Vince McMahon RuneScape quests Wayne Gretzky New York Mets 1986 NBA Draft Frank Viola Theory of conduct New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets World Championship Wrestling Paul Wight Philadelphia 76ers NFL Draft Penske Racing Dallas Cowboys Montreal Canadiens Kansas City Chiefs Brett Favre Oakland Athletics Troms__ I.L.
