who got better fantasy baseball trade i'm not saying who i was but who got the better deal the trade ichiro for erik bedard dan haren i think i made some mispellings this trade seems pretty fair and it depends on what the team needs i could see that the bedard side may need some pitching and they have good outfielders to give away ichiro they could have enough sb and avg to trade him to help there weakness in pitching on the ichiro side they could of had great pitching and needed a little help with sb and avg along with an outfielder so i can see this trade benefitting both teams good luck Batting average Baseball Manny Ram__rez Softball Seattle Mariners 1957 World Series November 2 in baseball November 1 in baseball Erik Bedard New York Yankees Boston Red Sox Detroit Tigers Cincinnati Reds Cricket Tris Speaker Pittsburgh Pirates Fast bowling Chicago White Sox Baseball statistics October 22 in baseball Houston Astros Japanese baseball Babe Ruth San Francisco Giants Baseball Stars Sammy Sosa October 27 in baseball October 30 in baseball Gary Sheffield Toronto Blue Jays October 18 in baseball Barry Bonds July 2004 in sports Randy Johnson Reggie Jackson 2004 World Series October 17 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Cricket pitch Los Angeles Dodgers Oakland Athletics Torii Hunter Baltimore Orioles October 14 in baseball Felipe Alou Pitcher Frank Viola October 25 in baseball Danny Ainge Jason Giambi 1919 World Series Umpire (baseball) Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Rusty Staub October 1 in baseball Bowie Baysox Wrigley Field Closer (baseball) Trade union Home run September 6 in baseball Football (soccer) positions October 19 in baseball Kansas City Royals Washington Nationals Ronnie Brown Brian Statham October 20 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals Harry Dalton Alex Rodriguez Luke Appling Stolen base Left fielder Mark Fidrych Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) 1991 World Series World Series Batting (cricket) Dave Kingman Philadelphia Phillies October 5 in baseball Melvin Mora October 23 in baseball October 16 in baseball October 15 in baseball San Diego Padres Montr__al Expos History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Laws of cricket Free trade November 3 in baseball Fantasy baseball Bucky Dent Robin Ventura Tommie Agee Hideo Nomo
