would you trade lt for frank gore well i play fantasy football on espn espn man roster start qb rb's a rb wr wr's te k defense and i was offered frank gore for lt at first im thinkin no way and i know fg is a lil banged up but is there any upside to this trade if you were in my position what would you do and why and here's a look at the rest of my squad qb tom brady qb alex smith rb ladainian tomlinson rb marshawn lynch rb deangelo williams rb garrett wolfe wr chad johnson wr santana moss wr marques colston wr santonio holmes wr ted ginn jr te jason witten te marcedes lewis d jaguars d dolphins k robbie gould secret asian man yea i had the st pick which i means i pick back to back after the st round so i got lt first then took tom brady and chad johnson back to back no you keep lt it's generally accepted in most fantasy roster that lt is number one and gore is number two and even then most experts agree that lt is far far above the number two position unless the person you're trading with is willing to offer a whole lot more along with gore i would pass your roster looks good the only concern i have is your defense but the defense usually doesn't score that many points unless you're playing an idp league and clearly you're not your te position could also use some work but what last year's fantasy numbers show us that tes don't always score many points even the great ones like gates and gonzales wow you have lt brady and chad johnson good draft September 2005 in sports New England Patriots New York Jets New York Giants December 2004 in sports Miami Dolphins Kansas City Chiefs Cincinnati Bengals Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVII October 2005 in sports Miami Hurricanes Football National Football League Baltimore Ravens January 2005 in sports Jacksonville Jaguars Running back NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Fantasy football (American) NFL Draft Detroit Red Wings Cleveland Browns Washington Redskins Dallas Cowboys American Football League New York Knicks Super Bowl XXXIX Randy Moss Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXXVIII October 2004 in sports LaDainian Tomlinson San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXXVI November 2004 in sports Doug Flutie Stage name Alex Rodriguez 109th United States Congress Oakland Raiders Previous World Wrestling Entertainment roster Super Bowl XXV International League Toronto Raptors Steve Nash Toronto Argonauts Los Angeles Kings New Mexico Lobo Basketball New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Yao Ming Atlanta Falcons Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Monday Night Football Super Bowl XXXVII NFL playoffs, 2003-04 ESPN 2005 Pro Bowl NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 Days of our Lives 108th United States Congress Canadian football Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.
