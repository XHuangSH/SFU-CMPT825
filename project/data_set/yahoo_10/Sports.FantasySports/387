rate my new team i've made changes to my roster let me know what you think here it is qb vince young rb larry johnson maurice jones drew wr reggie wayne lee evans t j houshmanzadeh te alge crumpler k robbie gould def green bay here's my bench qb jeff garcia rb deshaun foster wr drew bennett dwayne jarrett te zach miller def kansas city last year jones drew was surprise fantasy gold i doubt he'll repeat some of those games but he should still be good just not sure if he's a solid starter you should also keep in mind that the hunts are notoriously cheap and lj may not get the money he's looking for especially if back ups bennett and holmes develop also for those wayne harrison fanatics it would do well to remember that manning was less than spectacular during the post season last year which is when i really expected him to turn it on tony dungy has shown that the colts are gonna rely on the running game more so i doubt wayne will have as much value as a starting receiver even though most predict him to be a td receiver again this year he's still a better option than bennett or jarrett this may be because i'm a hardcore kc fan but green bay's d over kc's the lb core is upgraded as well as the d line and we got rid of baggage at the safety position i'd say that after jarred allen's two game suspension leave the green bay d on the bench Pittsburgh Steelers Carolina Panthers Green Bay Packers New York Jets Indiana Pacers Kansas City Chiefs Toronto Blue Jays Florida Marlins New York Knicks NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl A.J.
