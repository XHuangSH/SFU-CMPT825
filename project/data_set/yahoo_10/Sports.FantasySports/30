why is peyton manning being shunned he is the pick in any draft is it just me or is manning being given the boot he is the number pick period i know steven jackson had a good er excellent season lj is good too gore might get yards if healthy and shaun alexander is in top shape but manning has been the best qb in fantasy football for almost a decade he is a lock for yards and tds he will single handedly hand you a win on several occasions he and lt are the only two guys that you know will give you multipe point weeks with yahoo scoring i think i have just as good of a chance picking up someone in the rd round that goes for yards than i do getting jackson gore or alexander with the second pick you know you can name rbs that could be the best in the league lt lj travis henry with denvers offense willie parker steven jackson clinton portis frank gore shaun alexander rudi johnson or edgerrin james could each have the best season but manning is uncontested as the best qb in the league of ff maybe last year he wasn't much better than them but he is so reliable you know without adoubt he will be good the others could have an off year peyton doesn't have off years he doesn't have a proven rb rudy johnson deuce or steve jackson and indy will throw if they want to win with the nd pick in the rd round one of those backs of another good back like westbrook or chester taylor or thomas jones might still be on the board ok this is my th season in yahoo did i miss something i play a random public league every year and qb touchdowns have always been pts last year kitna had the same yardage with less touchdowns and more ints than peyton this was kitnas best year ever and he still falls pts or pts week below peyton if you want to average out the last seasons then you are really wrong i really think that there is a larger drop off between the qbs than there are between the rbs obviously lt is the exception hence the in any draft i think manning can go anywhere after the rd pick notice most of the backs you mentioned will go from the st nd round outside of james if you take manning nd you would only wind up with one of them and really how much better is manning than palmer brady brees September 2005 in sports Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Cleveland Browns New England Patriots NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Buffalo Bills Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XXI NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXVII Miami Hurricanes Football San Francisco 49ers Running back Super Bowl XXVI New York Jets American football National Football League Lore Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXII January 2005 in sports National Football League New York Knicks Doug Flutie Steve Young (athlete) Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXV 2005 Pro Bowl Donovan McNabb November 2004 in sports October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXXVI NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 December 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXXIV Jerry Rice Tennessee Titans Carolina Panthers Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl I Marvin Harrison Ryan Leaf Damon Allen Passer rating Super Bowl V Super Bowl IX Quarterback Super Bowl XIV Boston Bruins Indiana Pacers Super Bowl XIX St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XVIII Brett Favre Washington Redskins Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXVIII Randy Moss Terrell Owens Cris Carter Super Bowl XXXV New York Mets Baltimore Ravens Denver Broncos Bernie Kosar Chicago Bulls Canadian football Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XII Daunte Culpepper Deuce McAllister Mike Vanderjagt NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl VI Tom Brady Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXIX Los Angeles Clippers Philadelphia Eagles Glossary of American football Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl II Super Bowl III Dan Marino American Football League United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics Super Bowl XXXIII Sixty-first United States Congress Thirtieth United States Congress Leeds United F.C.
