fantasy football help please someone in my league dropped trent green and i don't know if i should pick him up we get a point for every passing yards points for td and for int i have steve mcnair and donavan mcnabb at qb what should i do thanks i just thought since both of my qb's have been injury prone trent green might be a better choice then mcnair don't bother you have one of the top fantasy qbs in mcnabb when he is healthy he rivals if not tops manning and mcnair is a decent backup i would put green and mcnair on a similar level so why do you need another qb sitting on your bench use the roster spot on a position that is more worthwhile Donovan McNabb Carolina Panthers Cleveland Browns National Football League Lore Steve McNair Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXXIV September 2005 in sports NFL playoffs, 2002-03 New York Giants New England Patriots American football Pittsburgh Steelers Baltimore Ravens Peyton Manning Steve Young (athlete) Baseball New York Jets Cincinnati Bengals Bernie Kosar Canadian football Trent Green Kurt Warner Kansas City Chiefs January 2005 in sports St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXXIX Tennessee Titans Miami Dolphins Trent Dilfer Super Bowl XXVII San Francisco 49ers Steve Nash New York Knicks Passer rating Super Bowl III Aerial (dance move) National Football League Fighting Fantasy Game Books Chicago Bulls Comparison of Canadian and American football Rugby league Glossary of American football Buffalo Bills Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XXXI Fantasy football (American) The Four Tops Football (soccer) Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXI Jerry Rice Draft (sports) NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXII Los Angeles Clippers Arena football Detroit Red Wings 1986 NBA Draft Daunte Culpepper St. Louis Cardinals Warren Moon December 2004 in sports Brett Favre NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Snooker Ultimate (sport) Super Bowl I Terrell Owens Montreal Canadiens Tom Brady Equine conformation October 2005 in sports Ricky Ray Rugby union Matt Hasselbeck Washington Redskins Chris Chandler Steve McManaman Professional wrestling throws Dan Marino Orlando Magic Damon Allen Syracuse University Orange MapleStory Billboard Hot 100 Madden NFL Chicago Cubs Professional wrestling Official (American football) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Monday Night Football Major professional sports league Leeds United F.C.
