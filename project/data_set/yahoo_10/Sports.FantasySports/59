rafael betancourt or joakim soria coming into this season betancourt's only real issue seemed to be that he is rather prone to the home run ball still he is a terrific reliever with a career k bb ratio and average against through this year in ip he has k against only bb which is truly amazing he also sports a era and a whip so if you need help in those cats he is an excellent addition however he won't provide saves and doesn't even seem to get into the action on vulturing wins he has only two this season since octavio dotel was traded to the braves at the deadline joakim soria has taken over as the royals' closer soria went for converting saves when dotel was injured earlier this season and will have plenty of fantasy value because he will pick up saves he got his first one since the trade on he doesn't have the gaudy numbers that betancourt has overall but they aren't too shabby in ip he has ks and bb ratio along with a era and a whip given the importance of saves in almost every fantasy baseball format he is the more valuable of the two he won't get a ton of saves since he is closing for the royals but it will be enough to make it worthwhile i'd recommend him as the better option unless saves are not a consideration for your team Baseball statistics Seattle Mariners 1957 World Series Florida Marlins John Smoltz Toronto Blue Jays 2005 World Series Batting average Boston Red Sox Chicago Cubs Mariano Rivera Carlos Beltr__n Major League Baseball No-hitter Oakland Athletics World Series Baseball Stars Reggie Jackson Gary Sheffield Barry Bonds Pedro Mart__nez National Football League International League Sammy Sosa Babe Ruth Hank Aaron Robin Ventura St. Louis Cardinals 1981 baseball strike Houston Astros Cincinnati Reds Atlanta Braves Baseball 1981 World Series Randy Johnson Sport Ty Cobb National Basketball Association New York Giants San Francisco Giants San Francisco 49ers Chicago White Sox Mois__s Alou Byung-Hyun Kim Pittsburgh Pirates Los Angeles Dodgers Manny Ram__rez 1986 National League Championship Series Curt Schilling New York Yankees November 3 in baseball Cleveland Indians Dennis Eckersley Tom Seaver 1999 National League Championship Series Satchel Paige Chicago Bulls Los Angeles Kings 2004 American League Championship Series Tim McCarver Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Carolina Panthers Baltimore Orioles Sandy Koufax Volleyball Rod Beck Red Faber Fantasy baseball Pete Rose Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Detroit Tigers San Diego Padres The Amazing Race Wayne Gretzky Willie Hern__ndez Rick Aguilera Ben Sheets Batting (cricket) Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Bowl Championship Series Joakim Bonnier June 11 in baseball New Jersey Nets October 2004 in sports Rickey Henderson October 26 in baseball Jos__ Canseco Alex Rodriguez New York Mets New York Knicks Tony Armas Jesse Orosco Sparky Lyle Ichiro Suzuki Los Angeles Clippers Jos__ Luis Jair Soria Roger Maris Save (sport) History of baseball in the United States
