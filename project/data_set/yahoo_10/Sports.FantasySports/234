quarterback controversy so i ended up with philip rivers and chad pennington in a league that has starting quarterbacks with people in the league my rd quarterback is brady quinn which i'm not particularly proud of rivers and pennington both had great seasons last year but what happens when they have bye weeks or if pennington decides it'd be a good year to get injured again i cant put quinn in can i he hasn't even signed a contract yet let alone have a chance to become the starter free agents are weak seeing as how theres starting qbs with teams in the league free agents consist of vick i wonder why jake plummer isnt he retired charlie frye derek anderson david carr the list gets worse and worse so my question do i keep quinn hoping he wins the starting job before one of my starters gets injured or has a bye week or do i make a trade to pick up a rd quarterback i would drop quinn watch him carefully and pick up carr carr is a fantasy sleeper this year if delhomme struggles early he will get his chance he has similiar number as delhomme last hear and played for a dismal team New York Giants National Football League New England Patriots Carolina Panthers Jake Delhomme Pittsburgh Steelers New York Knicks Cleveland Browns NFL playoffs, 2002-03 September 2005 in sports Cincinnati Bengals NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Buffalo Bills Toronto Blue Jays Detroit Tigers Super Bowl XXVII Miami Dolphins Donovan McNabb Doug Flutie NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Kansas City Chiefs Damon Allen Ricky Ray Super Bowl XXXVI Michael Vick Orlando Magic Chicago Bulls Playoff Minnesota Vikings December 2004 in sports Philadelphia Eagles Kurt Warner Quarterback 2005 World Series West Bromwich Albion F.C.
