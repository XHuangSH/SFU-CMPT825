this is a sports question i'm in a fantasy draft and i wanted to know who to take as the first pick i'm in a league for money and can't lose and i have first pick my brother keeps nagging me about taking lt and the other about peyton manning who should i take in the first round two words l t in almost every fantasy league a top rb like tomlinson is more valuable than a top qb like manning it is also harder to get a starting rb that does not share time than it is to pick up a starting qb because most rosters use qb and rbs there are starting nfl qbs but not all teams use only primary rb definitely go with the brother that is telling you lt and let your other brother waste his first pick on manning he probably has the spot and wants you to let lt fall to him National Football League New York Giants NFL Draft 2004-05 NHL lockout Peyton Manning New York Knicks Carolina Panthers Draft (sports) New England Patriots AFL-NFL Merger Pittsburgh Steelers Buffalo Bills Los Angeles Clippers New York Jets Minor league baseball Ryan Leaf New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Salary cap Orlando Magic Cleveland Browns Jerry Rice National Basketball Association Fantasy football (American) Playoff Atlanta Falcons Chicago Bulls American Football League Montreal Canadiens Jacksonville Jaguars Brett Favre San Francisco 49ers Indianapolis Colts American football Eli Manning Cleveland Cavaliers Match fixing Kansas City Chiefs Detroit Red Wings Major League Baseball Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXVII New Jersey Nets Indiana Pacers Toronto Raptors Reserve clause Washington Redskins Albert Pujols Tampa Bay Buccaneers NBA Draft Seattle Mariners Wheel of Fortune One Tree Hill (TV series) Cris Carter University of Miami January 2005 in sports San Antonio Spurs Drew Brees Donovan McNabb New Mexico Lobo Basketball International League September 2005 in sports Norway national football team National Football League Lore National Hockey League Utah Jazz Kerry Collins Memphis Grizzlies Tennessee Titans Daunte Culpepper Atlanta Hawks New Orleans Saints December 2004 in sports Canadian Football League John Elway Jokerit Boston Red Sox Oakland Raiders Steve Young (athlete) $ale of the Century NFL Europe Moe Berg Super Bowl Archie Manning The Contender (television series) Reggie Jackson Miami Dolphins Michael Vick Minnesota Vikings LaDainian Tomlinson Baltimore Ravens University of Tennessee Dallas Cowboys Lance Berkman Tampa Bay Lightning Kurt Angle Bundesliga (football) Denis Law Green Bay Packers Fantasy baseball
