should i make this fantasy football trade i get randy moss rudi johnson and hank baskett i lose marquis colston and travis henery that is a tough call if it was me i would say no first look at the rbs johnson is a consistent producer on a great offense he is almost guaranteed to get you around and at least tds henry had a good season last year with the titans but now goes to denver where undrafted backs become stars he has the potential to have a great season in their system possibly rush yards then compare moss and colston moss is going to have a better year with the patriots than the past few seasons with the raiders but he is no longer a clear cut elite wr on the other hand too many people are stuck on the fact colston had a great year last year he is moving into the spot and will see more coverage than before he still has a good shot to outperform moss though since the pats have so many weapons to spread the ball around to baskett is likely going to be the slot man for the eagles with brown and curtis starting he has the speed to break huge plays but will likely be highly inconsistent again this year therefore unless you really need baskett as a starting wr this trade is not worth it for you stick with henry and his huge potential New York Giants New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers New York Jets Buffalo Bills National Football League Lore Cleveland Browns Running back Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XII September 2005 in sports Randy Moss American Football League Glossary of American football Kansas City Chiefs St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XV Indianapolis Colts Oakland Raiders Cris Carter Super Bowl XXI NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl Super Bowl XIX American football Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXXIV NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXXI Donovan McNabb Denver Broncos Super Bowl XI Super Bowl IX October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXVI Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXVII Wide receiver Madden NFL Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl V Super Bowl I NBA Finals Super Bowl XIII 1957 World Series Super Bowl X October 2004 in sports Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XXXIII Pro Football Hall of Fame Terrell Owens Super Bowl XXV Indiana Pacers Dallas Cowboys Minnesota Vikings National Football League Super Bowl XVII NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXVIII Los Angeles Clippers New York Knicks Professional American football championship games Brett Favre American football strategy Norway national football team Super Bowl XVI Steve Young (athlete) Oakland Athletics Monday Night Football Super Bowl XXII Baseball Snooker Yao Ming Jerry Rice United States Football League World Series Kurt Warner Jake Delhomme Super Bowl XX Houston Rockets Seattle Mariners Poker jargon November 2004 in sports Buffalo Sabres Chicago Bulls January 2005 in sports Field hockey Toronto Blue Jays Anti-ballistic missile Damon Allen Miami Hurricanes Football NFL playoffs, 2000-01
