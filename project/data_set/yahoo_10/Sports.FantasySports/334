for a brand new fantasy football league how many keepers we're starting fresh with an team league that hopefully will grow to or in the years to come we're thinking a keeper league allows the teams out of the running to have something to shoot for next season how many keepers do you recommend for a standard league any other suggestions to keep the whole season interesting especially for those teams already out of the playoff picture the key to a keeper league is finding owners who are keepers people who will play every year owner turnover will wreck a keeper league we keep players per year one from each tier the st tier are rounds of the draft nd tier are rounds and tier are including all free agents picked up during the course of the season so for next year everyone decides on one keeper from each tier then each keeper moves up into the next tier the following year last year i got jones drew as a free agent he's my tier keeper obviously and he moves up to tier for next year if i keep him as my tier next year he moves up to my tier the following year and i''l presumably have a guy like s jackson in tier as well so i have to make a decision forcing me to throw a good player back into the draft for someone else or i trade him in the offseason another cool thing about keeper leagues every year the draft order is reverse of last year's standings and after year one since you're keeping players the draft lasts rounds instead of i can give you more details on year two and beyond if you are interested the ideal number of teams is teams aren't too stacked talent isn't too thin good fa pickups all year but teams still need to make trades let me know if you're interested in using this system and i can fill you in on all the details you need to know National Football League Pittsburgh Steelers Detroit Red Wings New Jersey Nets New England Patriots New York Knicks Buffalo Bills Major League Baseball Super Bowl XXVII San Francisco 49ers Utah Jazz Indiana Pacers Toronto Raptors American Football League Minor league baseball Orlando Magic New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Baltimore Ravens St. Louis Rams Cleveland Browns Reggie Jackson Oakland Athletics Carolina Panthers Playoff The Football League Mario Lemieux Yao Ming Cleveland Cavaliers Blackburn Rovers F.C.
