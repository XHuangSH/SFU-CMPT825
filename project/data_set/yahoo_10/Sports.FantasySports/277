whose more likely to pick up saves in texas benoit or wilson in the first save opportunity after gagne was traded the rangers stuck with c j wilson even though travis hafner was the only lefty due up in the ninth it worked out as wilson retired the side in order in a two run game then the very next day wilson struck out the only batter he faced lefty kenny lofton to record the save after joaquin benoit pitched innings of scoreless relief to get the win wilson has been so terrific against lefties that he doesn't make sense as a full time closer still he'll probably get a few more opportunities before the season is over my choice for a pickup would be benoit however he has gotten many more chances to work in close games than he did last year has a era a whip and strikeouts in innings this season wilson has such a wide disparity between how he does facing righties and lefties that he is likely only to get the call when a lefty is coming up at the end of the game even then it is possible they will use him in the th or th inning instead one other thing to bear in mind is that texas' first choice to close is probably akinori otsuka but according to the dallas morning news his forearm injury still isn't and the most realistic date for his return might be september there have been some rumors that otsuka may need tommy john surgery but the rangers' training staff is reportedly working on setting up a throwing program for him so i wouldn't count him out just yet he might be the closer in september if he became healthy 1957 World Series Baseball Sandy Koufax Satchel Paige Pedro Mart__nez Billy Wagner Chicago White Sox Nolan Ryan Los Angeles Dodgers World Series Toronto Blue Jays Babe Ruth Texas Rangers (baseball) Detroit Tigers Andr__s Galarraga 2001 World Series Softball October 5 in baseball 1986 National League Championship Series Lefty Grove 2004 American League Championship Series Grover Cleveland Alexander Houston Astros Seattle Mariners Chicago Cubs Perfect game Rich Harden 2005 World Series Jamie Moyer Washington Nationals International League October 4 in baseball October 21 in baseball Oakland Athletics Lefty G__mez Roger Clemens 2004 World Series St. Louis Cardinals Closer (baseball) Byung-Hyun Kim Strikeout Hank Aaron Florida Marlins Buffalo Bills Dennis Eckersley October 3 in baseball Mariano Rivera A.J.
