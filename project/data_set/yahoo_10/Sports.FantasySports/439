how should i set up a single list for the best results in an automated fantasy football draft i am playing in a fantasy football league on fox sports last year i tried my own mathmatical strategy for an automated draft but it bombed it is a single list of players and i would like to get good running backs and a qb in the first three rounds teams playing any suggestions for how many at each position i should choose and in what order to accomplish this would be helpfull thanks i've cut and pasted a long answer to another person's similar question the six team league will change the formula a bit and i don't know how fox's algorithm works but i thought the basic info might help you regards i've often thot about doin' an article for y sports about how to autopick successfully i managed to get a gold silver and bronze medal out of fantasy basketball teams last year via autopick for woohoo football's a little tougher but you can do it there are two main schools of thought reaching and reverse drafting one reaching if you're willing to skip say your fifth round pick you can reach for the rest of your draft rounds to are fairly predictable pre rank or leave y standard at least for rb's and wr's drop or exclude the qb's or you could end up w both bulger and brees too much value on the bench so assume picks are off the board by the time your th pick comes around you should then look to the player ranked or higher in the draft preferably by adp average draft position but the y pre rankings will do and put that ordinarily th round player in expecting him to be your th round pick repeat w player for the th then for the th etc multiples of of course if you're in a team draft in y leagues where the algorithm will autodraft a starting lineup before it moves on to the bench the computer will reach for the te's def and kickers for you so make sure none of them are ranked above in team it will take your highest ranked te df and k you may want to put bal or chi above the te's thus rounds will be a te df and a k still worse i think the algorithm will force you to take a backup of at least two of those positions killing rounds after the draft you can trade 'em or exchange 'em from best available on the waiver wire but again that's why it'd be important in this strategy to keep your kickers all the way to the bottom your second choice is to pre rank a reverse draft one guy did it in my y autodraft league very successfully reverse draft means to keep the first two rounds but do 'em only with rb's then insert gates at pick bears and vinatieri at that point you should have two good rb's including at least one stud and the premier te d and k it's now round a lot of live drafters will have waited til now for vyoung or kitna so you can put in two mid tier qbs selections if you want and you can play matchup managment qb by committee through out the year default will let you pick qb's and you don't want that so be sure not to put in more than names then just rank wr after wr the theory behind the strategy is to have the best scorer per position at the most positions you can use the strategy in a live draft but it's suitable for an autopick if it works you'll have the three best at te d k will be very competitive at the two rb spots as well as the wr after the top or so wideouts are gone wr's are all about the same and you should be okay at the qb and wr the drawback you'll be lacking at wr from the first week flyover and nobody can really predict the best d or k but reverse drafting can field a good team either method can be made more effective if you know your draft position ahead of time but we rarely do i'd be interested to know how it turns out stay up late pre ranking regards National Football League New York Giants Poker jargon Baseball Pittsburgh Steelers Norway national football team Carolina Panthers Cleveland Browns Playoff Rugby league New York Jets Canadian football Quicksort National Basketball Association Los Angeles Clippers New England Patriots San Francisco 49ers American football strategy Super Bowl XXVII Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Rugby union Tag Yao Ming Chicago Bulls Single Transferable Vote Prisoner's dilemma Cincinnati Bengals FA Cup Glossary of American football Toronto Raptors Bundesliga (football) Counter-Strike Troms__ I.L.
