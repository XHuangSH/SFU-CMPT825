would you trade randy moss for terrell owens in my league i'm being offered ownes for moss the only reason im hesitating is because tony romo showed signs of inconsinscy last year and brady is for sure thing wow a lot of people are split on opinions here i would personally take this trade and here's why sure randy moss is with a prime time quarterback in tom brady but look around him donte' stallworth wes welker ben watson troy brown tom brady is not known as a quarterback to have one reciever he mainly throws to like when moss was in minnesota but as a quarterback who likes to use all of his weapons and spread the ball around and this was before when his best reciever was deion branch so imagine what tom brady will do with all of those different weapons he's not just going to focus on one guy he'll do what he does best spread the ball around that's what makes tom brady such a good quarterback so don't expect randy moss to have one of those seasons like he had in minnesota with daunte culpepper but don't expect him to have one like in oakland either he should have a decent season but not an outstanding one now with the to thing terrell owens is in a dallas system where his only competition for touchdowns is terry glen and jason witten and they aren't even that big of competition terrell owens although he is very cocky and selfish is still one of the top recievers in the nfl no matter what to proved last year that even with a weak starting quarterback for a few weeks in drew bledsoe he can still lead the league in recieving touchdowns i'm confident that tony romo can come into this season and return to his prime form but even if he can't he will somehow find a way to throw owens touchdowns so eventhough romo may not have a stellar season and tom brady is one of the best quarterbacks in the league trade away randy moss for terrell owens Super Bowl XXXVI NFL playoffs, 2004-05 San Francisco 49ers National Football League Lore Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XXXI September 2005 in sports Terrell Owens Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl X Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXVI St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XII Tom Brady Super Bowl IX Oakland Raiders Baltimore Ravens Miami Dolphins Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXXVIII Daunte Culpepper National Football League October 2005 in sports NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXIII December 2004 in sports Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl V Super Bowl XVII Washington Redskins Super Bowl XVI Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XI October 2004 in sports Carolina Panthers Monday Night Football Jerry Rice January 2005 in sports Super Bowl II Super Bowl VI Steve Young (athlete) Brett Favre Super Bowl XXXV NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Madden NFL Ben Roethlisberger Super Bowl XVIII Drew Bledsoe Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXII Pro Football Hall of Fame World Series Super Bowl VII Quarterback Super Bowl XXX American Football League NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Bernie Kosar Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XXXIII NFL playoffs, 2000-01 Toronto Argonauts NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXIX Ricky Ray Boston Red Sox Trent Green NFL playoffs, 1998-99 Doug Flutie Canadian football Trent Dilfer Detroit Tigers Toronto Blue Jays
