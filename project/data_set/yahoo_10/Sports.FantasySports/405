good fantasy football trade i don't like it but this guy is trying to pressure me into it i get marques colston and laveranues coles for reggie wayne and mark clayton no do not do this trade colston had a great season last year but he will not surpass his last year stats by much maybe yds or so coles is getting old and he plays well but there is not much upside with him wayne is getting better each season and this year he will be a top wr he will have a great year and could possibly become manning's favorite target clayton has played well and should stay consistent as he has been playing coles and clayton are pretty much even but coles a little more upside wayne is a lot better than colston and his stats will show do not make this trade keep wayne for sure unless you are getting a better deal for him Wayne Gretzky Los Angeles Clippers Barry Bonds Reggie White Green Bay Packers Wayne Rooney National Football League Oakland Athletics Alex Ferguson Damon Allen Super Bowl XIX Philadelphia Flyers Troms__ I.L.
