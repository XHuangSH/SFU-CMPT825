need advice on fantasy football what position to pick first hi i was wondering if anyone can tell me what is the best order to pick positions or should you pick by players i know the first round its best to just get the best player you can like lt but what order should i pick players is it best to draft a quarterback first or defense or running back etc thanks so much for your help also if you have any good info on sleepers and people to avoid i really appreciate it i dont want to look like an idiot in my husbands league and ive tried to searching but everything these days requires money to get advice its commonplace to pick a running back in the first round the only exception would probably be peyton manning but only if you're at the bottom of the order running backs will normally get you the most points also look at your rules as points are given differently in all leagues not sure how much you follow football but if you're drafting soon i'd stay away from larry johnson who will be near the top of most lists there's no guarantee he'll be playing this year just some friendly advice good luck to you you'll do fine National Football League New York Giants Pittsburgh Steelers NFL Draft Peyton Manning Canadian football Buffalo Bills Kansas City Chiefs NBA Draft American Football League Super Bowl XXVII San Francisco 49ers Baseball Carolina Panthers Rugby league Glossary of American football Quarterback Michael Vick Draft (sports) The Football League Ryan Leaf Miami Dolphins National Basketball Association Rugby union New York Jets National Football League Lore Gaelic football Salary cap New York Knicks New Mexico Lobo Basketball Dallas Cowboys Wide receiver Comparison of Canadian and American football Poker jargon Los Angeles Clippers Super Bowl XXI Pok__mon Trading Card Game Indianapolis Colts Major League Baseball Match fixing Norway national football team Cleveland Browns Super Bowl IX Chicago Bulls Miami Hurricanes Football Cheating in poker Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XIV Running back Toronto Raptors Fantasy football (American) John Elway Touch football (rugby league) Football Baltimore Ravens January 2005 in sports Playoff Torquay United F.C.
