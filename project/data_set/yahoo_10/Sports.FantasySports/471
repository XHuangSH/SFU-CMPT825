fantasy team does this sound like a good line up starters philip rivers frank gore maurice jones drew thomas jones roy williams lee evans chris cooley ravens d st robbie gould bench warrick dunn isaac bruce mike furrey michael vick jeff garcia joe horn michael bennett also should i start vick if he doest'nt go to jail or w e honestly i wouldn't believe what other people are saying yes get rid of vick he is worthless this year other than that this team isn't that bad rivers could be a hit or miss this year honestly i believe that with gates and lt he will be on and put up huge numbers garcia is going to be the starter in tb and should put up decent numbers not great but he will get some pts on the bye week for you your rb core is solid for the most part i would get rid of dunn and get norwood with dunn just having back surgery its no telling when he will be they are saying he will be ready for the season but i wouldn't believe that with surgery also bennett he plays for try getting a guy like jackson out of gb or tatum bell in det they are both projected starters and could turn out huge for you your wr is core is good on the front lines but on the bench your hurting badly bruce is going to be replaced by bennett sooner rather than later horn won't get the catches he had with vick there furrey will see his numbers go down massively with johnson probably becoming the nd receiver you might want to try and get guys like curtis sometimes matt jones is there reggie williams even rookies like gonzalez and ginn will have good years cooley is going to go as the qb in washington goes its that simple he is a player who is in a huge role this year and when everybody else struggles so will he i wouldn't depend on him being a big help in the fantasy points section robbie gould was wonderful last year but don't expect the same numbers grossman sucked badly last year and got lucky half the time also with benson being the only back there nobody knows how he is going to do i wouldn't expect much out of him for the first couple of weeks until grossman and benson get together and moving even though stats wise he was the number kicker i believe he isn't worth it ravens d enough said overall its around a its not that great but its not that awful as most people are saying you have some players that will be putting up huge years expect gore to put up the same numbers that he did last year and catching more passes mjd might be splitting the carries with taylor but since taylor is injury prone expect mjd to do most of the pounding your wr' s are good aslong as their qb's are good forgot thomas jones with jones being the back in nyj he should put up good numbers with nobody really looking over his shoulder he should keep that number spot throughout the entire year he is a good rd back in any team well you should be somewhere around maybe if you get lucky i wouldn't expect a championship but you will give somebody a run for their money last thing don't start vick good luck Pittsburgh Steelers San Francisco 49ers NFL playoffs, 2002-03 1957 World Series Cleveland Browns Carolina Panthers Buffalo Bills Michael Vick New York Jets Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXVI New York Knicks Super Bowl XXVII Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXV Running back Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXXIV Florida Marlins Detroit Tigers Chicago White Sox World Series October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XIII Indiana Pacers Super Bowl X Poker jargon National Football League Lore Super Bowl III Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl IX Toronto Raptors St. Louis Rams Super Bowl V Kansas City Chiefs Los Angeles Clippers Satchel Paige Boston Red Sox Major League Baseball television contracts Glen Jacobs 1986 NBA Draft Montreal Canadiens Detroit Red Wings Ocean's Twelve Leeds United F.C. 2005 World Series Kurt Angle 106th United States Congress January 2005 in sports National Football League Donovan McNabb Knots Landing September 2005 in sports Hendrick Motorsports Super Bowl XXII Minnesota Vikings Troy Glaus Super Bowl XXIII Penske Racing Baseball Tris Speaker Super Bowl I NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics Sixty-sixth United States Congress 2003 World Series Roush Racing Los Angeles Kings Eighty-second United States Congress 104th United States Congress Reggie Jackson Oakland Athletics Ninety-seventh United States Congress Chicago Bulls 1981 baseball strike 100th United States Congress Norway national football team Seattle Mariners Ontario general election, 1981 Robin Ventura Friends 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Super Bowl XVIII
