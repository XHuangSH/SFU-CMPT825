fantasy football help should completions be worth point or of a point for qb's also should i give points for rush and pass attempts in my league also what does a ppr league mean and how does it work thanks i don't recommend points for completions for qb's it'd make them worth about each team's weekly score it puts too much emphasis on the qb position if you like the option you can also deduct points for incomplete passes thus rewarding efficiency when commissioners do that i usually see them do it pt for each completion and pt for each incompletion or and i don't much like that tho because it can penalize for throwing the ball away to avoid a sack if you insist on points per completion you can also give rb's points per rush but that devalues the receivers see below you can also balance out the qb's by giving them only pts for passing td's and like point every yards ppr points per reception and it's the only way to play it really evens out the receivers and te's with the running backs it does change the value of some of the studs westbrook and bush come to mind but that's ok imho in ppr leagues you still have the stud rb's followed by the second tier but in traditional formats the second tier are pretty much all rb's and there's about of em in ppr the wideouts expand that tier and make the position relevant it keeps the pick in team format from being too shall we say lt heavy and makes more teams more competitive in team leagues for example it makes stephen jackson comparable but still behind lt's projected numbers i'd suggest not going points per rush or points per attempt but definitely try points per reception regards American football Glossary of American football Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl X Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXV Rugby league Super Bowl XVII National Football League Lore Wide receiver San Francisco 49ers Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXIV Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XI Volleyball Pittsburgh Steelers Kansas City Chiefs Ultimate (sport) American football strategy Football (soccer) Super Bowl XII Quarterback Running back Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl V Rugby union Super Bowl I Super Bowl XX Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XXIII American Football League Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XXXII National Football League Australian rules football Passer rating Super Bowl XVI Miami Hurricanes Football New England Patriots Poker jargon NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 The Football League Softball World Football League Super Bowl XXVIII Gaelic football Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XXXIX Baseball Super Bowl II Donovan McNabb Indoor football Iron Bowl Michael Vick Touch football (rugby league) Miami Dolphins New York Jets Extreme Programming Terrell Owens Water polo St. Louis Rams All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Buffalo Bills Philadelphia Eagles Quizbowl NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXX Reggie Jackson Baltimore Ravens Official (American football) Punt (football) Major League Baseball television contracts Bryan Robson Joe Paterno NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Damon Allen Hearts (game) Super Bowl VIII Playoff
