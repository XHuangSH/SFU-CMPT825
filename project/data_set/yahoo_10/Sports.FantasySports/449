fantasy baseball help guerrero and accardo for braun and konerko a trade has been offered to me i would trade away vladamir guerrero and jeremy accardo and i would get braun and konerko if arod ends up on the angels next year guerrero might have a better year than braun and konerko combined this is a keeper league so i am not sure what to do please help wow very intriguing trade both for the reason of there are many ways you can look at it and because the players are not very comparable but the trade seems pretty fair as far as the rest of the season goes this is a pretty fair trade but think who are you going to keep for your keeper league are you going to keep vlad yes are you going to keep accardo absolutely not not to mention the fact that bj ryan will likely re assume the closers role next year which dwindles accardo's value considerably ryan braun has had arguably better numbers than ryan howard had in his similar situation the first time he was brought up look how he has turned out this deal is completely contingent on whether or not you believe ryan braun will continue the pace of his hitting or not i personally think he is the real thing to an extent though his sick numbers he has put up will likely level out you are probably not going to want to keep konerko unless you keep really really deep which i doubt if this trade were not in a keeper league i would say by all means pull the trigger if you need the offensive help i think both of you will be extremely happy with the trade i would probably not make this trade just from the standpoint that you will keep vlad one of the top fantasy players in baseball even if you are really hot on ryan braun he will probably be available again i'm not sure how many players you keep by the time you draft if he is not kept people will be more apt to draft prooven players with those first picks than to take a flier on braun very intriguing trade but i would hold on to vlad on account of having him in the future 2005 World Series Baseball Chicago White Sox Oakland Athletics Vladimir Guerrero Seattle Mariners Nolan Ryan Toronto Blue Jays Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Major League Baseball Washington Nationals Minor league baseball Pittsburgh Steelers San Francisco Giants Alex Rodriguez New York Mets Utah Jazz National Football League New York Giants Los Angeles Kings Houston Astros Randy Johnson Robin Ventura Boston Red Sox St. Louis Rams Cleveland Browns Yao Ming Final Fantasy XI Los Angeles Dodgers Glossary of American football Los Angeles Clippers Eddie Guerrero Reggie Jackson Microeconomics Andr__s Galarraga Softball Dracula Pittsburgh Pirates Paul Konerko Indiana Pacers Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Team Fortress Classic American football Computer role-playing game San Antonio Spurs Chicago Bulls Vlad III Dracula Babe Ruth Ty Cobb American Football League Super Bowl XXVII Draft (sports) Theodicy Batting average Hank Aaron Toronto Raptors Texas Rangers (baseball) NBA Draft Goodness and value theory Detroit Tigers 2005 American League Championship Series Chicago Cubs Legacy of Kain Major League Baseball television contracts October 23 in baseball Baseball statistics Ryan Leaf Topps Montreal Canadiens Troy Glaus International League Mario Lemieux Atlanta Braves New York Knicks 2004-05 NHL lockout Roger Clemens Red Sox Nation Chris Benoit Martin Heidegger November 2 in baseball World Series Home run Poker jargon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Xiaolin Showdown 1981 World Series Orlando Magic Theory of conduct Science fiction on television
