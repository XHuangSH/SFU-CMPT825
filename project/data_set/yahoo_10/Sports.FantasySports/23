should i pick up jeff francis or tim lincecum this is actually a pretty tough decision jeff francis has won straight games and is in games those are some incredible numbers right there in the long run he would get more wins than lincecum even if he plays in a hitters friendly park tim lincecum is having a good year but he won't get as many w's he is also a good pitcher and he will get more k's than francis they are both good pitchers so it really depends on what you need more if you need w's i would go with francis if you need k's go with lincecum good luck 1957 World Series 2005 World Series Baseball Toronto Blue Jays Batting average Pittsburgh Steelers October 4 in baseball New York Giants Earned run average Pedro Mart__nez Softball Switch hitter 1987 World Series San Francisco Giants New York Yankees Baseball statistics September 20 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals 2004 World Series Win (baseball) 2003 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates San Francisco 49ers 1989 World Series October 16 in baseball Reggie Jackson Barry Bonds Mike Scioscia Atlanta Braves New York Mets Chicago White Sox Houston Astros October 20 in baseball 2004 American League Championship Series Perfect game Baseball Stars Designated hitter Greg Maddux 1903 World Series Hank Aaron October 26 in baseball Jeff Bagwell Boston Red Sox Nolan Ryan Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry New York Knicks 1981 baseball strike Randy Johnson 1986 World Series June 2004 in sports Red Sox Nation 1993 World Series No-hitter Frank Viola Cincinnati Reds Norway national football team Wes Ferrell 2002 World Series World Series Andr__s Galarraga Major League Baseball All-Star Game Montr__al Expos Save (sport) Sandy Koufax Tim Wakefield October 19 in baseball October 21 in baseball Robin Ventura Florida Marlins Yankee Stadium 1986 NBA Draft Cleveland Browns Pete Rose Pitcher October 31 in baseball Luis Tiant Lefty Grove October 10 in baseball Chicago Bulls October 5 in baseball Home run Edgar Renter__a Roger Clemens Closer (baseball) International League Marius Russo June 2 in baseball Carl Yastrzemski Tim Hudson 1985 World Series October 22 in baseball Bullet Rogan Hideo Nomo Alex Rodriguez Ty Cobb George Brett (baseball) June 11 in baseball $ale of the Century Houston Rockets October 9 in baseball
