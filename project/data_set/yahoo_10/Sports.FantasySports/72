steven jackson i'm being offered randy moss larry fitzgerald willis mcgahee calvin johnson and roy williams for steven jackson vincent jackson bernard berrian and andre johnson i'm the one who has steven jackson and them should i do this trade i've got ladainian tomlinson your team's backfield is ridiculous i am not sure how you pulled off lt and jackson they are the top draft picks without a doubt as great as it would be to have both of those monsters on your team i actually kind of like this trade i think mcgahee can be a solid back he certainly won't match the numbers of jackson but you have lt so take a look at the wrs you can get fitz and williams who are both among the few elite fantasy wrs and would definitely be an upgrade over johnson and berrian picking up moss as your rd wr is a decent value and you would also have calvin johnson who has enough talent to have a breakout rookie year along the lines of randy moss actually so although it is tough to part with the overall rated player i think your starting lineup is picking up enough upgrades to balance out the decrease at rb i would go ahead and take the trade only because you already have tomlinson Running back Buffalo Bills New York Giants New York Knicks San Francisco 49ers Miami Hurricanes Football Toronto Raptors New England Patriots September 2005 in sports Pittsburgh Penguins December 2004 in sports Indiana Pacers New York Jets LaDainian Tomlinson Los Angeles Kings Boston Red Sox 1986 NBA Draft New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Randy Moss Dallas Cowboys Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXVII Los Angeles Clippers Montreal Canadiens Toronto Blue Jays National Football League Houston Rockets October 2005 in sports World Series Atlanta Flames New York Yankees Boston Bruins Randy Johnson Seattle Mariners Reggie Jackson University of Miami Satchel Paige Cincinnati Bengals Steve Nash Drew Rosenhaus Orlando Magic New Jersey Nets Oakland Athletics Chicago White Sox Jerry Rice Stage name Michael Jordan Academy Award for Original Music Score NBA Draft Super Bowl XXVI Yao Ming Continental Basketball Association NBA Finals San Antonio Spurs Minnesota Timberwolves The Jackson 5 Qu__bec Nordiques Eighty-sixth United States Congress Hendrick Motorsports Super Bowl V Larry Bird New Mexico Lobo Basketball Washington Redskins Cris Carter Willis McGahee Detroit Tigers Ontario general election, 1995 Oakland Raiders National Basketball Association Super Bowl XII Ben Johnson (athlete) Detroit Red Wings New York Mets Sixty-first United States Congress Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XVI Phoenix Suns WNBA Draft Essendon Football Club Los Angeles Lakers Florida Marlins Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl I Dallas Mavericks June 2004 in sports October 4 in baseball V8 Supercar StarrCade November 2004 in sports Toronto Argonauts Ty Cobb 1973 NHL Amateur Draft Utah Jazz NFL Draft Troms__ I.L.
