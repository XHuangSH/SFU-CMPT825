what do you think of the vam value above mean drafting system i'm the th pick in a team league and vam says i should take steve smith with my th pick and grab a rb in the third round in the fourth i should take the best qb i had planned to draft rb rb wr wr so vam drafting is a very different approach what do think of the vam system i've just heard it called value based drafting but either way i think it is good and bad in man leagues i think it's less advantageous than in man leagues because when position runs hit you stand to lose a lot of depth at a position if you pick th i think it would be a good move to take smith or manning if he's available but you better use a pick on a rb too if you don't you have to wait until the th pick to get one if your league is like most the majority of the players will take a rb's in rounds that means your rb options will real thin by the time it gets back to you your spot the wrap is the best place other than you can be in because you'll have no anxiety about if your pick will be there for your next pic if i were you i would take either manning or the best wr in round a rb round a wr or qb round depending on what you took in round a rb round a def round a wr or rb in round and go from there a te will probably be your next pic but you can let that one slide a little because there are a bunch of good options at te this year i think your rb rb wr wr strategy isn't the best option for such a large draft because you'll never get the best player at any position unless you go def for your th pick Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics National Football League NFL Draft Super Bowl XXVII Chicago Bulls Pittsburgh Steelers Buffalo Bills New York Giants Minor league baseball Baseball New York Knicks NBA Draft Toronto Raptors Poker jargon Carolina Panthers Major League Baseball Blackjack Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move) Playoff Equine conformation Draft (sports) New England Patriots Los Angeles Kings 1986 NBA Draft Lance Berkman New York Mets Volleyball Detroit Red Wings Orlando Magic Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.
