should i drop bonderman his last three starts have been absolutely atrocious and his era is now up to pitchers with better numbers especially lately such as brian bannister matt garza jeremy guthrie and adam wainwright are all available in my league but i'm still hesitant because bonderman was an early round pick for me what was i thinking and i still have some faith that he might turn it around help i would keep bonderman bonderman is a solid pitcher just going through a slump like the rest of the team he and the tigers are too good not to break out of it besides bannister plays on a terrible team and wainwright is too inconsistent bonderman also plays for the best offense in mlb Baseball Boston Red Sox Cleveland Indians July 2005 in sports 1957 World Series Major League Baseball All-Star Game October 28 in baseball World Series International League Major League Baseball San Francisco Giants Chicago White Sox Florida Marlins 1987 World Series Baseball statistics New York Giants Cleveland Browns Detroit Tigers 2005 World Series New England Patriots Luis Tiant Sammy Sosa November 3 in baseball Pittsburgh Steelers Scott Kazmir Earned run average Nolan Ryan Reggie Jackson Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game New York Yankees 2004 World Series West Bromwich Albion F.C.
