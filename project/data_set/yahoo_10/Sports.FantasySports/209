why do so many people want you to rate their team it's ridiculous and it's always people who are in or team leagues where rosters are so stacked no one really knows how good a team is until the season start and the players distinguish themselves speaking of the season not starting a really decent assessment just can't be had until a couple weeks into the season someone could have lt to peyton and steve smith for example in a team league which is freakin amazing but then they can all go down in the first week for the season and all of a sudden your team sucks if you're one of the people asking please stop do some research and analyze your team yourself i understand that you could never get the players i mentioned in a team league that was my point douche my other point was that its morons like you who have these loaded teams because you drafted in an team league and then you come on here looking for someone to your hold no analyzation can be made about a single team without knowing what the other teams look like and what the rules of the league are it gives people something to talk about i like looking since it gives me ideas on how some people draft and thier though process both from the asker and the answerers people love playing fantasy football and they want to talk about it as soon as the the camps start to open if everyone did thier own research then there would be no need for a yahoo answers website and both you and me would need to find something else to do with our time National Football League New England Patriots Super Bowl XXVII Minor league baseball New York Giants Playoff American Football League Peyton Manning National Basketball Association Major League Baseball New York Knicks Sudden death Canadian football Baltimore Ravens American football Carolina Panthers World Football League Jacksonville Jaguars Chicago Bulls Buffalo Bills Rugby league Indianapolis Colts Newcastle United F.C.
