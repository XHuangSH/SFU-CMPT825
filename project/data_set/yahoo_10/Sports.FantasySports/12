who should i pick in fantasy football in one of my leagues i'm the seventh pick in a team yahoo ff league i've already picked a rb in the first round 's have already been taken as far as yahoo projected for this year i feel like if i don't take a reciever they will be gone by the time it gets back around to me but i need another rb who should i take is up next then obviously so i'm up really soon thanks its the second round how bout taking a qb if your feeling lucky take a guy like palmer or bulger a second running back would be wonderful right now though if you could get a guy like addai or maroney then i would jump all over it most leagues will have both of those guys gone though you can jump with the wr and take smith i would only take smith if your really feeling lucky with your rd pick take another wr then take a qb if you wanna stretch your odds take james with your th pick and then gates def with your th one its really up to you if you don't want to get stuck on the short end of the stick take a rb and feel confident about your team you can take the chance and choose a wr but make sure smith is there if its not him don't even take a wr but take another rb good luck Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXVII New York Giants Carolina Panthers Buffalo Bills The Contender (television series) Cleveland Browns Norway national football team New York Knicks Canadian football Satchel Paige New York Rangers NFL Draft National Football League Lore Gambling New England Patriots West Bromwich Albion F.C. 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 September 2005 in sports American football 2005 English cricket season National Football League Social rule Los Angeles Clippers Brian Close Press Your Luck Sport FA Cup Super Bowl XXVI Max Martin Super Bowl XXXVI Rocky Marciano Wide receiver Aerial (dance move) Dallas Cowboys Chris Amon NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Sheepshead NBA Finals Crystal Palace F.C.
