who would be the first three picks in fantasy football i have the third pick by the way he should i hope to get ladainian tomlinson frank gore and steven jackson should be the first picks in every league tomlinson is the consensus though you wouldn't want to win your league by drafting him because it would take away from the accomplishment if he has another dominating season gore is every bit as good as tomlinson and on a san francisco team that is poised to make it back to the playoffs and contend for the super bowl jackson is probably the sure thing because he wasn't last year's rushing leader the rushing leader usually gets hurt the following year edgerrin james was the last to repeat winning rushing titles in and though he got hurt in and he doesn't have a history of injuries in college and the td scoring problems that gore has had some people will tell you to draft larry johnson shaun alexander or peyton manning in the top larry johnson is holding out and will probably get hurt if he does play about a chance that he isn't worth a st rounder at the end of the year shaun alexander wasn't all that good last year even before the foot injury and probably isn't worth taking until at least the rd or th round by which time he's long gone peyton manning is a quarterback and it is a waste of a draft pick to take a qb early you can get of the value of a top tier qb in the middle to late rounds such as matt leinart phillip rivers tony romo or jay cutler just to name a few all of them should throw for yards and tds while peyton manning is likely not to surpass yards and tds you should always take rbs and wrs in the first rounds or so in rounds you should try to get a qb romo rivers leinart etc should be available and your te you won't get the elite few but you'll be able to get a jason witten vernon davis or kellen winslow though otherwise rbs and wrs are still the best picks in rounds you should take another qb and more backs and wrs in rounds and or whatever the last rounds are in your draft you should take your kicker and defense New England Patriots Super Bowl XXVII Cleveland Browns New York Jets September 2005 in sports Cincinnati Bengals Carolina Panthers Buffalo Bills American football Super Bowl XXI Peyton Manning Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl IX National Football League Lore Miami Hurricanes Football NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 National Football League NFL playoffs, 2003-04 New York Knicks Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXXIV October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXVIII Dallas Cowboys Running back Donovan McNabb Baltimore Ravens St. Louis Rams Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl X Super Bowl III Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl XIII San Diego Chargers Super Bowl XXIV December 2004 in sports Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XV Damon Allen Indiana Pacers NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Tennessee Titans Super Bowl VII November 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXXII USC Trojans Football Michael Vick Chicago Bulls Los Angeles Clippers Super Bowl XX NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Detroit Red Wings Denver Broncos Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl IV Dan Marino NBA Finals San Antonio Spurs Ryan Leaf LaDainian Tomlinson Brett Favre Super Bowl XXXIII Canadian football Oakland Raiders Terrell Owens 2005 Pro Bowl Super Bowl XXXVIII Doug Flutie January 2005 in sports Super Bowl VIII Marvin Harrison Matt Leinart New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Michael Jordan Iron Bowl Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XXXVII
