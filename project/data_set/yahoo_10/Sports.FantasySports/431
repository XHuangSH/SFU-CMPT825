anybody else play in a ffl where you have to start qb's each week just about every ffl website and magazine is based on a system where you only start qb each week which way undervalues qb's compared to a league where you have to start we have a team league and have to start qb's each week so it changes things a lot just wondering if anybody else is in a similar league and how that setup impacts your draft strategy i'm mulling a lot of options right now like going qb qb wr wr with my first picks and then getting a bunch of rbbc guys and hoping a couple of them pan out our league is really competitive and i'm trying to consider some outside the box ideas to see if i can come up with something that might work we start rb's wr's and te no kicker we do individual defensive players too which i think is awesome it adds more dimensions to strategy options i drafted demeco ryans as my sleeper pick at lb last year and he ended up being the highest scoring defensive player in the league unfortunately i also had mcnabb and mark brunell without a jason campbell handcuff so that didn't work out so well yes i do team league you still have to get two rb's in the first two rounds then probably next would be two qb's or one qb and one wr just make sure your qb's have different bye weeks and try to get three because after the draft you will be stuck with them do to the rest being taken if you need to trade for a qb in this type of league they are worth as much if not more than rb's so get on them early and don't be afraid to get extra to use as trade bait National Football League New York Giants Carolina Panthers Pittsburgh Steelers Playoff Super Bowl XXVII Minor league baseball American football New York Jets New England Patriots Poker jargon FA Cup Dallas Cowboys New York Knicks Bundesliga (football) Ra (board game) Philadelphia Eagles Glossary of American football Baseball Buffalo Bills Canadian football Cincinnati Bengals Donovan McNabb Los Angeles Kings Rugby league Detroit Red Wings The Inside Paintball Super Bowl XXXVI Softball Alex Ferguson Yao Ming San Francisco 49ers September 2005 in sports Los Angeles Clippers Ultimate (sport) Wheel of Fortune Utah Jazz National Hockey League All-Star Game Comparison of Canadian and American football Ice hockey Kansas City Chiefs Terrell Owens Super Bowl IX Toronto Raptors League Cup National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVI American Football League Counter-Strike Playoff format New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets NBA Draft Tris Speaker Ty Cobb Chicago Bulls Nolan Ryan Major League Baseball National Hockey League Steve Nash Topps National Basketball Association Tampa Bay Buccaneers Extreme Programming Volleyball Oakland Athletics International League Gaelic football Robin Ventura Jokerit Dallas Mavericks Troy Glaus Canterbury Bulldogs Draft (sports) NFL Draft Miami Dolphins Indiana Pacers FC Rostov The Apprentice 2 Brett Favre Norway national football team Ryan Leaf World Series Orlando Magic Atlanta Flames National Rugby League Penalty shootout (football) Leeds United F.C.
