is this a good trade i get payton manning he gets donovan mcnabb matt jones and philadelphia i think its good matt jones is a chump and is third on the jax depth chart no loss there mcnabb was the top qb in fantasy befefore he got hurt and there's the key tossing in the philly defense is a small price to pay for that kind of consistency and reliability with manning the guy is a rock and is a sure tds the only risk and it's probably a small one is that tarik glenn retired from the colts o line he's been a critical cog in that line we don't yet know how this will affect manning or addai for that matter still if you have any kind of decent defense i'd take that deal manning is worth it plus you can use those two free roster spots to speculate on other players for your bench including a replacement defense do it New York Giants Donovan McNabb New England Patriots Philadelphia Eagles Indianapolis Colts Pittsburgh Steelers September 2005 in sports Toronto Raptors Los Angeles Clippers NFL playoffs, 2003-04 NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Carolina Panthers Oakland Athletics Terrell Owens American football Cleveland Browns Tris Speaker Philadelphia Phillies National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXXIX New York Knicks NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Cincinnati Bengals 2005 Pro Bowl Dallas Cowboys Seattle Mariners New York Jets Gary Payton (basketball) Kobe Bryant Super Bowl III Baseball January 2005 in sports Houston Astros Buffalo Bills Ra (board game) Indiana Pacers Tax Utah Jazz Super Bowl XXVII International League Chicago Bulls NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Baltimore Ravens NBA Finals December 2004 in sports Donovan St. Louis Rams Pete Rose November 1 in baseball Boston Red Sox Houston Rockets Ian McNabb The Waterboys Microeconomics Poker jargon Toronto Blue Jays Glossary of American football Leeds United F.C.
