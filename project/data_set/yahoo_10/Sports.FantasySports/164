which sp would u rather have kazmir or verlander kazmir has been nasty so far this nd half and verlander isnt doing well at all so i looked at his numbers in the nd half he had a era of about last season and it looks like it will continue he has a era of this season so far in nd half so should i trade him away in the end i believe that verlander is a better pitcher than kazmir kazmir will get more strikeouts but verlander gets more run support leading to more wins however he does have a tendency to struggle in the second half i would trade him while he's hot for a good player in return so for the second half i'd rather have kazmir but in general i would rather have verlander Scott Kazmir Toronto Blue Jays Tampa Bay Devil Rays Nolan Ryan Randy Johnson Pedro Mart__nez Sandy Koufax Grover Cleveland Alexander Boston Red Sox Houston Astros 1957 World Series Seattle Mariners Baseball International League Baseball statistics Batting average Cincinnati Reds Baseball Stars John Smoltz Pittsburgh Steelers Roger Clemens Los Angeles Dodgers Curt Schilling Don Newcombe Kevin Brown Early Wynn Andr__s Galarraga November 3 in baseball Bob Friend Greg Maddux Satchel Paige Byung-Hyun Kim Oakland Athletics San Francisco Giants Jack Sanford Milt Pappas Pittsburgh Pirates Florida Marlins Hideo Nomo Hal Newhouser Detroit Tigers David Cone Chicago White Sox Doyle Alexander St. Louis Cardinals Lefty Grove Luis Tiant Robin Roberts (baseball player) World Series Bucky Walters November 1 in baseball Buffalo Bills Wes Ferrell Earned run average Carlos Zambrano Chicago Cubs Super Bowl XXVII 2004 World Series Jamie Moyer 1981 baseball strike Neal Cotts St. Louis Rams Joaqu__n And__jar Mark McGwire Barry Bonds Monte Ward Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 November 4 in baseball Red Ames Tim Hudson Brad Radke Mariano Rivera Major League Baseball Wilbur Wood Washington Nationals Jim Palmer Al Leiter Firpo Marberry Dave Kingman Johan Santana Reggie Jackson New York Yankees October 3 in baseball A.J.
