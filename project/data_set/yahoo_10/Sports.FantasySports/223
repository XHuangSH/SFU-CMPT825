why does everyone play multiple teams this is my third season playing fantasy and i've always just ran with one team i'd hate to have to do the research and effort i put into my one team every week for two three even four teams yet a lot of owners in my winners league are playing multiple teams i can see why you might play teams one year if you're trying to get into the winner's level next year but whats the point after that doesnt it take away some of the agony and ecstasy when you have different teams playing every week how can you root for your players any given week on one team when you're playing against them on another and then people stop playing the teams that go and by week and you're matched up against teams whose starters went on ir weeks ago i just dont get it i wish they'd limit you to one team per account on yff oh and rate my only squad please i was drafting rd from last first time i had such a low draft pick so it was a new experience for me willie parker rb maurice jones drew rb marc bulger qb larry fitzgerald wr andre johnson wr hines ward wr chris cooley te jamal lewis rb bernard berrian wr matt leinart qb julius jones rb jerry porter wr carolina def nate kaeding k desmond clark well what about all the teams you give up on its not like you can delete them they keep going on autopilot and frankly it ruins the game for the rest of the league they're in that's still paying attention its not much of an accomplishment winning a man league if the other players abandoned their teams for ones that got better draft position be a man stick with one team come hell or high water and show how good you really are at ff you have a great point there are many reasons why people have more than one team though they like doing live drafts and enjoy drafting with other players they use them as a mock draft at the beginning of the season for money leagues later in the season as practice they think they have the time to handle everyone to tell you the truth this is my first year for fantasy sports and i have fantasy baseball leagues and fantasy football leagues i enjoy doing the drafts but have much more than i can handle it is way too much to change the lineup everyday for fantasy baseball on every team but some how i do it i won't be doing so many leagues next year though i have never done fantasy football so i have no clue what it is like i know that you only have to change the lineup once a week so you can handle more than one team it would be tough to do all that research and effort in every team you have a great point and i will think twice about having more than teams next year good luck edit for your only team lol you have a great squad i would wait until the season starts before changing anything i hate doing trades before the preseason at least because you don't know how your players will do you might have a player that you want to trade now but he is incredible in preseason i would wait before doing any moves National Football League New England Patriots New York Giants Pittsburgh Steelers St. Louis Rams Minor league baseball Super Bowl XXVII Cleveland Browns New York Knicks Chicago Bulls Dallas Cowboys Carolina Panthers Los Angeles Clippers Playoff Major League Baseball Baseball National Basketball Association Buffalo Bills World Series Toronto Raptors San Francisco 49ers 1981 baseball strike American Football League Minnesota Vikings Cincinnati Bengals New York Jets New York Mets Babe Ruth Leeds United F.C.
