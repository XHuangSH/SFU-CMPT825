fantasy baseball question who should i play i'm having trouble figuring out who to play in my fantasy lineup any advice would be appreciated points to the best answer here they are b mark teixeira nym or prince fielder col of pick curtis granderson vs tb jermaine dye vs cle mark teahen vs min melky cabrera tor b fielder he has tons of power and will get you lots of hr's and rbi's if you are already strong in hr's use texiera but i would go with fielder of granderson and cabrera granderson is a good choice because i just read a recent stat that said he has had a run in of his past games plus he bats lead off for a tiger's offense that seems to be breaking out of its slump i would also start cabrera because look at what he has done in his past games he is one of the hottest players in baseball right now he has at least a game hitting streak a batting average that is very very close to he has and he has had at least rbi in of his past games play cabrera for sure good luck Baseball Baseball statistics Toronto Blue Jays 2004 World Series 1981 baseball strike Boston Red Sox World Series New York Yankees Lance Berkman 1957 World Series Detroit Tigers Miguel Cabrera Robin Ventura Baseball scorekeeping Mois__s Alou International League Cecil Fielder Lou Gehrig Sammy Sosa Softball October 4 in baseball Ichiro Suzuki Troy Glaus Fielding (cricket) Orlando Cabrera Bob Johnson (baseball) Gary Sheffield October 22 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga 2003 World Series 2004 American League Championship Series 2005 World Series Florida Marlins Rudy York Alan Trammell Pete Rose Ty Cobb Tris Speaker Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Hal Trosky Willie Mays October 3 in baseball Baseball Stars St. Louis Cardinals Reggie Jackson Carl Yastrzemski Miguel Tejada October 2005 in sports Manny Ram__rez Ted Williams Barry Bonds October 16 in baseball Rennie Stennett Alex Cabrera Dixie Walker Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Jason Bay Atlanta Braves Dave Concepci__n Jim Northrup Jim Rice Oakland Athletics Torii Hunter Japanese baseball Bobby Abreu Kansas City Royals 2001 World Series Ron Gant Duke Snider Batting (cricket) Chuck Klein Home run November 3 in baseball Hank Greenberg English cricket team 1993 World Series Frank Howard (baseball player) Luke Appling Bobby Kielty Tony Armas New York Mets David Ortiz Kirby Puckett New York Giants Laws of cricket Nolan Ryan October 10 in baseball Brook Jacoby
