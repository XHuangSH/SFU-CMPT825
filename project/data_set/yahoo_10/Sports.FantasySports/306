i am new to fantasy fooball so how should i draft ex rb rb wr wr qb qb or rb wr qb rb wr qb or in which order would u draft draft like this depending on how high your pick is if you got i would do it like this anything after that i would take running backs and then see about the qb situation and then make the wr your last shot since in most public leagues the wr isn't that highly valued you can choose to take some options there guys like ward boldin r brown philly should still be there in the th round your first it might look like this lt s jackson l johnson gore alexander gore and alexander switch a lot just depending on who is drafting after that i would end up taking receivers guys like harrison holt and johnson should still be there i know its not the greatest thing but once you get the rest of the draft you should be ok th and th pick could be mcnabb and edge th and th you could end up with gates gonzalez shockey in that order and then ravens bears san diego def in that order th and th i would take another receiver it won't the best player but guys like cotchery mark clayton could be there a rd receiver isn't your biggest concern also maybe get a kicker in the th after that your really drafting your bench players like qb smith green pennington maybe even kitna could be there also rb's like lewis norwood bell t jones maybe even benson could fall to you the wr i might go with ginn gonzalez matt jones brandon jones guys who could be number 's on their team you don't need a second kicker def te they can both be picked up on your bye weeks and you will be fine good luck Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants New York Jets San Francisco 49ers NFL playoffs, 2004-05 New England Patriots Cincinnati Bengals September 2005 in sports New York Knicks National Football League Lore Los Angeles Clippers Buffalo Bills Carolina Panthers Cleveland Browns Baltimore Ravens NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Super Bowl XXXVI NFL playoffs, 2003-04 National Football League Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XXI Philadelphia Eagles 1986 NBA Draft Detroit Tigers San Antonio Spurs Super Bowl XXVI New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Chicago Bulls NFL Draft Donovan McNabb Kansas City Chiefs Miami Hurricanes Football Thirty-third United States Congress NBA Draft 1984 NBA Draft Tight end NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Survivor Series Indianapolis Colts Utah Jazz June 8 in baseball Indiana Pacers University of Miami Terrell Owens Super Bowl XXII ESPN25 Running back Super Bowl IX Toronto Blue Jays Archery at the 1996 Summer Olympics Randy Moss Super Bowl XXV WWE Unforgiven Washington Redskins Orlando Magic Montreal Canadiens Toronto Raptors Winning Streak Oakland Athletics Los Angeles Kings Troy Glaus Super Bowl XXXIX St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XIII Satchel Paige Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XXXIV WWE Vengeance Super Bowl XXIV The Great American Bash San Diego Padres Brett Favre 2005 NFL season Glossary of American football Australia at the 2004 Summer Olympics October 2005 in sports Tennessee Titans Tampa Bay Buccaneers Fifty-seventh United States Congress Thirty-first United States Congress Super Bowl XXIII Ty Cobb November 2 in baseball Extreme Programming Canadian football NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 106th United States Congress 1981 baseball strike Super Bowl XVIII October 4 in baseball Poker jargon Super Bowl XXXVIII United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Reggie Jackson
