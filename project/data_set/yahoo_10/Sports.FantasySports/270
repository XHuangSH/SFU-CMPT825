fantasy baseball trade points league managers i get prince fielder he gets paul konerko dan haren adrian beltre should i do it who gets the better deal this is also a keeper league so i would probably be keeping prince for next year i would definately do this deal a trade at this point in the season is going to have a very minimal effect as far as standings at the end of this year go as far as the trade fielder is better than konerko even if you would not be keeping him at the end of the season it is debatable whether adrian beltre actually helps your fantasy team or not i personally would not play him and regardless you can easily find a more than capable backup on waivers same with haren you won't find a pitcher of quite his status on waivers but you can definately find someone suitable solid fantasy starting pitchers are a dime a dozen in the middle rounds of the drafts see sabathia and brad penny are extreme success stories this year from the middle rounds but this is where i typically grab all of my starters because pitchers with very few exceptions are extremely variable and lets be serious you're not keeping any of these players at the end of the season anyway think of this trade in terms of that you are combining players statistics that you wouldn't want to keep into one player that you definately would this deal would be great at any point in the season and is especially valuable in that you can take fielder with you at the end of the season for very very little Baseball 2005 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Chicago White Sox Baseball statistics Boston Red Sox Oakland Athletics Indiana Pacers Houston Astros Los Angeles Dodgers Softball Major League Baseball Carlos Beltr__n Alex Rodriguez Kansas City Royals New York Yankees Detroit Tigers National Football League Detroit Red Wings Barry Bonds Pittsburgh Pirates Robin Ventura New York Giants New York Knicks Baseball Stars Reggie Jackson Randy Johnson 2004 World Series Texas Rangers (baseball) New York Mets Paul Konerko Negro league baseball Fantasy baseball Nolan Ryan International League New York Jets John Smoltz Minor league baseball Roger Clemens 1957 World Series October 15 in baseball Tris Speaker Ichiro Suzuki Florida Marlins 1919 World Series Los Angeles Clippers Pedro Mart__nez Greg Maddux Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Babe Ruth Dallas Green Cleveland Browns Chicago Bulls Fielding (cricket) Toronto Raptors Hank Aaron Hank Greenberg Lance Berkman Yao Ming World Series San Francisco Giants Damon Allen Cincinnati Reds Major League Baseball All-Star Game Hideo Nomo Arizona Diamondbacks Carolina Panthers Designated hitter October 23 in baseball Rickey Henderson November 1 in baseball Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Utah Jazz Super Bowl IX Los Angeles Kings November 2 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals 2003 World Series St. Louis Rams Dixie Walker Cricket Pittsburgh Steelers MLB Most Valuable Player Award David Wells Cleveland Indians Frankie Frisch Bernie Williams New England Patriots Atlanta Braves October 2004 in sports
