rate my fantasy football team please it's a team league here's my team qb peyton manning rb reggie bush rb marion barber iii wr chad johnson wr lee evans wr calvin johnson te vernon davis w r adrian peterson bn bernard berrian bn mike furrey bn jerry porter bn matt schuab bn randy mcmichael bn reuben droughns k olindo mare def san diego please tell me how i did what i did good and what i did bad what i need to improve anybody i should add drop and any trades that i should make if you want to you could also rate it thanks hey i was offered this trade what do you think i get reggie brown and fred taylor and i give bernard berrian so should i accept thanks for the tips your team is actually not bad but you do have room for improvement for another draft here is what i suggest don't take peyton manning or a quarterback in the first rounds period in general there are exceptions if you get the right value this is hard to grasp for newer fantasy players simply for the fact that quarterbacks earn the most points the problem lies in the statistics specifically the standard deviation of the top qbs besides manning the reason for not picking him is slightly different but related all the same the difference between say a matt hasselbeck and a say trent green as i am drawing a blank for a good comparison at the moment is not great im comparison to say reggie bush compared to a lamont jordon there are better examples of this but i'm just trying to get the gist across there are definately instances where you should pick a qb earlier but it is only when the value is right there is no real way to definatively explain how to do this as you kind of have to get a feel for it this is where experience comes into play pick feature backs a big hole in your team which isn't terrible but could hurt you as far as scoring consistancy is concerned is that you have backs starting that split carries i like reggie bush and i would pick him where you did he is phenominal and i think he is one of the most exciting players to watch in the nfl his pass catching ability which is really derived from the type of offense no runs makes him consistent points wise barber though i go to the u of m and love him could potentially be a dangerous pick you could see the trend of dallas giving him more and more carries throughout the year especially in goal line and rd down situations but he is still not getting all of the carries he is not a bad back in the least and you will be happy with the tds which is what scores points are concerned but he will have some weeks in which he scores points which hurts from your back stay away from rookies again just as a rule though i have to say calvin johnson and ap are not awful picks rookies can potentially be complete busts and generally do not come close to reaching the levels they are hyped to achieve even a rookie who has a good year may not have a stellar year fantasy wise much less is expected from rookies when compared to veterans so their stats are judged accordingly remember numbers are important not names in this game as far as the rest good pick on the d i think san diego is the nd best d this year d is not important in fantasy again because they are extrememly inconsistent from week to week olindo mare is just fine pick a kicker in the last round if you want it really doesnt matter though i have to say this year i have been reaching for better d's and kickers because i have been getting depth fairly early and can afford it i'm sure you can do the same one last thing be careful of drafting too many big play recievers their overall numbers are good and they can win you a week all by themselves but to win a fantasy football league your team has to be consistent in other words you don't want your reciever core to be joey galloway lee evans santana moss evans was no doubt the best guy available when you got him but again i'm just giving you general hints anyway good job not a bad team in the
