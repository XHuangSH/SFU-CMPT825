rate my fantasy team qb marc bulger rb steven jackson rb jamal lewis wr reggie wayne wr andre johnson wr isaac bruce te todd heap k david akers dst broncos dst here is my rundown on your team qb marc bulger is no superstar but he is a good reliable quarterback unless if he gets injured bulger should be good for td passes and yards the rams will likely run the ball more than pass with stephen jackson so this could affect bulgers stats this shouldn't matter too much to you though because you have stephen jackson on your team rb's stephen jackson is ready for another great season and next to lt i think he will have the best season out all nfl running backs jamal lewis on the other hand i'm not so sure of lewis is coming off a few off seasons in baltimore and with his age he may be unable to rebound in cleveland lewis though should get the majority of the carries for the browns which will help out his stats wr's reggie wayne is ready to step up and try to overshadow marvin harrison in indianapolis and is ready for a great season andre johnson was one of the best recievers in the league last year but with a new qb in matt shaub he could have a little trouble getting used to him right away johnson should heat up by the end of the season issac bruce will be playing the slot in st louis and will likely make little impact on your team te todd heap is one of the best tight ends in the league and should have another succesful season he is a strong point on your team k david akers is past his prime as a great kicker in the nfl and on not a super offensive team in philly akers is just your average kicker dst the broncos have great defensive backs and should get lots of interceptions their linebackers defensive line lineman and special teams are just average however so this dst will score only above average points compared to other dst's after fully looking at your team i give them an good luck in your fantasy season New York Jets Super Bowl XIV St. Louis Rams Indianapolis Colts Carolina Panthers Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl X Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXIV September 2005 in sports Glossary of American football Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl III Miami Dolphins American football Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XIX Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXXIII National Football League Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl VII Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl I January 2005 in sports Running back Super Bowl XVII Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXXI Kurt Warner NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Super Bowl VI Canadian football Wide receiver American football strategy Super Bowl XXXII Denver Broncos NFL playoffs, 2002-03 November 2004 in sports Super Bowl XV December 2004 in sports Indiana Pacers New York Knicks Peyton Manning American Football League Super Bowl XX NFL playoffs, 2000-01 Dallas Cowboys Donovan McNabb World Series Super Bowl XXX Brett Favre October 2004 in sports Miami Hurricanes Football Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl Super Bowl VIII Defensive team San Diego Chargers Jacksonville Jaguars NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 NFL Most Valuable Player Award Washington Redskins Super Bowl IV Arena football Cris Carter Tennessee Titans Chicago Bulls 2005 Pro Bowl Monday Night Football Ben Roethlisberger Tight end Minnesota Vikings
