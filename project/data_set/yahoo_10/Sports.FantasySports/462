best spot to pick in nfl fanstasy football draft teams having a lottery tonight to pick slots in upcoming fantasy draft if i win i would take the pick lt after that i'm not sure where i would like to pick if i dont get the first pick i think i'd rather wait until later in the round to make a selection this way i would get a early nd round pick as well any suggestions i ended up w the rd choice i chose to take the th slot i figure i will get one of the tops rb's or manning plus i sit right in the middle of each round for my next picks thanks everybody i believe that the closer you can get to the middle of the round the better this year there seems to be an elite rbs that should go before all others to get th last of those aka th spot would be the best with getting a better nd round pick the next best spot would be to ensure good rbs with a team draft it is hard to predict how far down the line you'd have to be for there still to be a good rb still left in the nd round but you'd likely have to be pretty close to the end to go st is great to get lt but really you're next pick isn't until you lose all sorts of talent by the time your nd pick comes around good luck Norway national football team New York Giants New England Patriots New York Knicks Draft (sports) NFL Draft Super Bowl XXVII National Football League San Francisco 49ers Wheel of Fortune Cleveland Browns Winning Streak Orlando Magic Buffalo Bills Gambling Minnesota Vikings Toronto Raptors Atlanta Falcons New York Jets Poker jargon Chicago Bulls Dallas Cowboys NBA Draft Lottery Tampa Bay Buccaneers New Mexico Lobo Basketball American football WWE Draft Miami Dolphins Cleveland Cavaliers Super Bowl IX Jerry Rice Quicksort New Jersey Nets Steve Nash New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets 1986 NBA Draft Los Angeles Clippers Press Your Luck Playoff Match Game Kansas City Chiefs $ale of the Century The Contender (television series) WNBA Draft Yao Ming San Antonio Spurs Tennessee Titans Jacksonville Jaguars Los Angeles Kings National Football League Lore April 2005 in sports New York Mets 2004-05 NHL lockout American Football League Peyton Manning Tag 1957 World Series Lottery Indianapolis Colts Ryan Leaf Utah Jazz Pittsburgh Penguins University of Miami England national football team The Joker's Wild Terrell Owens Fast bowling New Orleans Saints Washington Redskins Troms__ I.L.
