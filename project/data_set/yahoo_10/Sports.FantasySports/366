is clinton portis going to last the whole year i'm thinking about taking portis as my second starter for my fantasy football team but im not sure if he will play should i take him in the rd round i don't think he will survive the whole season he's had tendinitis in his knees bad enough to keep him out of practice and will be seeking yet another medical evaluation with off season shoulder and knee surgeries and the emergence of laddell betts portis smells like a bust to me betts proved he could carry the load he had over yards with only starts at the very least he will take some of clinton's cheese i would take him if he slides into the third round but i have him flagged as a player to avoid i wouldn't hesitate to reach for betts perhaps as early as the th round the kid can play New York Jets Denver Broncos Super Bowl XXVII Pittsburgh Steelers New York Knicks New York Giants Miami Hurricanes Football New England Patriots Running back Daunte Culpepper West Bromwich Albion F.C.
