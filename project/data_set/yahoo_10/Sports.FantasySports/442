should i trade a trade proposed to me was willie parker for edgrin james and andre johnson my other wr are j walker t glenn and e kennison other rb's are sjackson j jones and c benson oh i am getting parker honestly it isnt a bad trade either way however i do think edge is going to be a really solid top back this year as is willie parker so i would keep your depth at wr and rb if you give up johnson then that leaves you with only top reciever and t glenn is hurt and kennison isnt a huge points guys so no i wouldnt do it keep your depth and it will work out better if an injury pops in on you good luck New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers 1957 World Series San Antonio Spurs New York Knicks Super Bowl XXVII Pro Football Hall of Fame Running back Sixty-sixth United States Congress Jazz Glenn Miller 1986 NBA Draft Grammy Awards of 1983 Buffalo Bills Baseball Stars USS Kennison (DD-138) Fifty-seventh United States Congress Seventieth United States Congress Thirty-second United States Congress 102nd United States Congress Toronto Raptors Thirty-third United States Congress 101st United States Congress Samples of music from the United States Eighty-second United States Congress Jerry Coleman Sixteenth United States Congress Fifty-fifth United States Congress Seventy-second United States Congress Sixty-fifth United States Congress Thirty-first United States Congress Seattle Mariners Willie Nelson Miami Vice Stage name Super Bowl XXI V8 Supercar Super Bowl XXXVI Sixty-eighth United States Congress New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Grammy Awards of 1975 100th United States Congress Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame Guitarist Fast bowling Sixty-third United States Congress September 2005 in sports Prince (artist) Chicago Bulls Dallas Cowboys Boston Red Sox Wisden Cricketers of the Year Twenty-eighth United States Congress Cincinnati Bengals Thirtieth United States Congress Sixty-seventh United States Congress Los Angeles Clippers Chicago White Sox Twenty-fourth United States Congress Boston Bruins Pedro Mart__nez Chicago Blackhawks Detroit Red Wings Songs in the Key of Life Super Bowl XXXI Academy Award for Best Art Direction Tony Award for Best Musical Double bass Andr__ the Giant Sixty-fourth United States Congress The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Grammy Awards of 1984 2000 Australian Grand Prix English cricket team Indiana Pacers Sarah Jessica Parker Virtuoso The Love Boat NASCAR Rookie of the Year Super Bowl XXXIV NBA Finals Ontario general election, 1995 Scott Glenn Music of Canada Graham Parker Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1930-1970) TLC World Championship Wrestling Sunday Times Rich List 2004 Thirteenth United States Congress Nick Johnson Rod Stewart Super Bowl XXVI Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay ALGOL 68 MacArthur Foundation Buffy the Vampire Slayer Ninety-seventh United States Congress
