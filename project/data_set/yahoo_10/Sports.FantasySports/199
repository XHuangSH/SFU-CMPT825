who are the most reliable rbs at or my roster has only three rbs so i can't risk an injury a rbc or a drug issue who are the most reliable rbs rules man roster qbs rbs rec wrs tes pks def st weekly lineup qb rb rec pk def and utility player any position scoring all tds are pts passing pts for first yards passing additional point for each additional yards rushing rbs wrs and qbs receive pts for yards additional point for each additional yards receiving rbs wrs and qbs receive pnts for yards additional pt for each additional yards completions qb receives bonus pts for or more interceptions fumbles lost pt each extra points are pt field goals yards or shorter are pts additional pt for each additional yard yard fg is pts point conversions are pts def st shutouts are pts tds are pts sacks are pt turnovers are pt safeties are pts blocked kicks are pt well since you are looking for a reliable running back you should look towards teams who only have the one running back your first since it seems you haven't drafted yet should be along the lines of the best running backs in the league of course also since you have the last pick in your draft it seems henry could be there along with guys like ronnie brown if your guys in the league your competing in aren't that smart maroney and addai might be there but they could be along shot if your looking for a rd back you could go for a guy like ahman green edge also you might get lucky with guys like deuce barber iii and my fav mcgahee i personally would stay away from guys like deuce barber j jones bush mjd taylor betts portis just because they are playing in a system with backs they might put up semi good numbers but if you can get yourself a starting back its always worth a lot more just because they will get most of the carries i choose mcgahee in this situation green and james are great rb guys but with mcgahee he is a starter and one of the main sources of offense in bal he should be putting up huge numbers this year last year he had yards and touchdowns for a really bad bills team if he stays healthy this year and produces like most people think he will he could end up at yards and touchdowns i personally think he is a great th round guy but since you have the last pick you can take him at anytime if you want to try and draft later assuming its not a keeper league guys like green and james will come off around even a guy like j lewis will come off the board around or so i don't recommend lewis just because i don't believe that you shouldn't take a rb unless that team has a qb there is no balance so everybody will be focused on stopping you another way to go would be young guys like lynch and b jacobs i would stay away from peterson just because like i said before he is in that split back system with taylor i believe that its easiest for a rb to come up and start but taylor did have a good year last year and will be splitting time with him so i take mcgahee at or since your looking rb if your going to look later try james or green if you want to press your luck even further you could get lewis or jacobs good luck Super Bowl V Miami Hurricanes Football Super Bowl X Running back New England Patriots Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XII Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIII San Francisco 49ers NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Canadian football Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl III New York Jets Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXII National Football League Lore Super Bowl XI Donovan McNabb American football strategy Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XIX Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XVI September 2005 in sports Super Bowl VII NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Miami Dolphins NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl VI Football (soccer) Super Bowl XV Baltimore Ravens Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl I NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl II Super Bowl XXXIX Deuce McAllister Cris Carter American Football League Damon Allen NFL playoffs, 2004-05 NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 Iron Bowl January 2005 in sports Indianapolis Colts Dan Marino Wide receiver November 2004 in sports Steve Young (athlete) Randy Moss Volleyball National Football League Baseball Kurt Warner Super Bowl XXIX NFL playoffs, 2000-01 Super Bowl IV Toronto Raptors Ronnie Brown Super Bowl VIII Rugby league NFL playoffs, 1990-91 NFL playoffs, 1982-83 Quarterback Carnell Williams Doug Flutie NFL playoffs, 1997-98 Fantasy football (American) Super Bowl
