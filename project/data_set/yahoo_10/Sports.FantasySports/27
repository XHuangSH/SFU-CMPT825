i've got the pick in my ff league i'm pretty sure lt and steven jackson and larry johnson will be the top picks in my league so which rb would you draft th overall joseph addai frank gore or shaun alexander let me know why i'd go with addai the colts realized this past offseason that they dont have to make manning throw the ball times a game to win it they're able to grind it out on the ground i think they're going to use the running game a whole lot more and there arent any other decent running backs on the colt's roster i'm a little sour on alexander had him in leagues last year got burned and i don't like seatle's offense this year they didnt perform last year and now they lost darrel jackson i like addai more than gore because of gore's injury history and the fact that he may not get goal line carries michael robinson stole some last year other than that addai is a better receiver than either of them i gotta take addai with this pick honestly i would take him ahead of lj in a draft seriously Pittsburgh Steelers San Francisco 49ers New York Giants Chicago Bulls Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXVII Cleveland Browns New York Knicks New York Jets Baltimore Ravens Utah Jazz Miami Dolphins World Series Indiana Pacers Carolina Panthers Seattle Mariners Detroit Red Wings Los Angeles Clippers Buffalo Bills Chicago White Sox Toronto Raptors Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl III American football Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXVI Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl V New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Larry Bird Boston Red Sox Chicago Cubs New York Mets Super Bowl XXI San Antonio Spurs Toronto Blue Jays Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XIV Michael Jordan Indianapolis Colts Dallas Cowboys Orlando Magic New Jersey Nets 1957 World Series Steve Nash Baseball Yao Ming Volleyball Super Bowl VII Houston Rockets Baltimore Orioles Florida Marlins National Football League Super Bowl IX Detroit Tigers Cincinnati Reds NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Reggie Jackson NBA Finals Oakland Raiders Ty Cobb Montreal Canadiens Super Bowl XXIII September 2005 in sports Cleveland Indians Satchel Paige Los Angeles Dodgers Super Bowl I Super Bowl XII Super Bowl VI October 4 in baseball Super Bowl XXV Major League Baseball American Football League NBA Draft Minnesota Twins Super Bowl X Portsmouth F.C.
