fantasy football help please this is my second year drafting but i know a lot about football however i never heard of the tier strategy until the other day how would you use a cheat sheet and the tier strategy would you reccommend it for these settings how do you use a cheat sheet do you cross off the players as they are drafted what would be your strategy for these settings thanks so much in advance qb qb wr wr wr rb rb te w r w r k def def bn bn bn bn bn bn completions passing yards yards per point points at yards points at yards passing touchdowns interceptions rushing attempts rushing

points allowed points points allowed points points allowed points points allowed points the tier strategy refers to your personal rankings of players for instance let's go with these rb's lt stephen jackson frank gore joseph addai shaun alexander travis henry larry johnson lawrence maroney brian westbrook willie parker rudi johnson my personal tiering would be st tier lt overall you can use more than one player per tier but lt is alone as the top rb nd tier stephen alexander i also think he's the clear cut rd tier shaun alexander frank gore joseph addai larry johnson and travis henry th tier brian westbrook willie parker rudi johnson and lawrence maroney as far as crossing off on a cheatsheet i would use a personally ranked cheatsheet do your own research and type one and print it up then use highlighters to cross them off my cheat sheets or cross off lists are tiered and seperated by position i wouldn't use an all position sheet because you may end up searching for ever for a player because he's on a list of or so if you seperate them they're a little easier to find now my draft strategy is to always grab as many quality rb's as possible because if you break it down there are really only starting rb's in the nfl because teams use a running back by committee approach where they split up the duties depending on situation or what have however since you guys start qb's i would suggest trying to get a top qb but don't reach if you can stock up on rb's i don't know how many teams are in your league but i'm going to assume if i'm right then you guys will start qb's per week and there are starters so the supply outweighs the demand whereas with rb's and your w r position where people will use rb's your demand outweighs good supply same supply and demand deal with wr's each nfl team starts at least and some or so you can say there are about or so starting wr's and at least who will be on the field at all times in your league with starting wr's and the w r position the supply outweighs the demand so get yourself two quality rb's and depending on whose available at your next pick go with the best player unless the rb is only marginally less better than the other position for instance don't pass up on lawrence maroney for a carson palmer because in another round or two you'll still be able to get a guy like matt hasselbeck or maybe even donovan mcnabb at qb but your rb's will be players like lamont jordan etc i would draft as follows st rb nd rb rd rb unless a huge star at another position far outweighs the quality of rb that's available there will be few teams with quality backs so you might as well be one of them th qb or wr you will need star qb at least th qb or wr you will need star wr so in round and take qb and wr depending on who's the best player at their position in those rounds th wr th wr th qb i usually like to wait on te's k's and defenses the reason is that the disparity in the top players at these positions is only something like a scoring change whereas the other position is far greater your rb will outscore your rb by over whereas your k will only outscore your k by the aforementioned now it sucks not having a top player at k te and d but if you take the best player available instead of filling in your lineup while you draft then you'll have quality players on your bench that you can trade once you see where the te's k's and d's are performing even chicago may not produce awesomely so why waste a high round pick on them when you can get a good wr instead and then trade for d if the one you drafted doesn't work out my sleepers at te are eric johsnon no who has the chance to be top if he stays healthy marcus pollard who works for a coach who loves using his te's and david martin in mia who'se coach also loves his te's you can get these guys late and cheap for defense i love seattle they picked up some awesome free agents for an already tough d maybe the best linebacking core with tatupu and peterson i don't have any at k as i usually use my last two rounds on k's and if i really need an upgrade at the position then i'll trade for one my strategy with k's is obvious though indoors is better especially late in the season and you want a k from a high point scoring offense Super Bowl II Cris Carter New York Knicks Super Bowl XXXVII Indiana Pacers Dan Marino 2005 Pro Bowl Daunte Culpepper November 2004
