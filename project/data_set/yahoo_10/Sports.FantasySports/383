who should i jinx with the first pick in the draft i just have a bad feeling that whoever i select will have a career low year in stats due to an injury or other happening the league has teams so my next picks won't be until and so they will be much less stressful i would hate to ruin lt's string of great years but i am leaning towards drafting lt any thoughts ps this may be fair warning for anyone else with a st pick in their draft if i select lt it may be the kiss of death lt will not have a record breaking year like last year he's still worth a number pick and he'll still be in the top come the end of the year but expecting a monster year like last year is expecting a bit much if you can try to trade with one of the guys who has a pick in the top trade the number pick for the a number pick and his rd or th round pick then with your new first round pick take one of jackson gore alexander or johnson you've still got a great rb and you've got an extra rd or th round pick New York Knicks Chicago Bulls NBA Draft Wayne Gretzky Pittsburgh Steelers Toronto Raptors Los Angeles Clippers New Mexico Lobo Basketball Orlando Magic Indiana Pacers Houston Rockets New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Yao Ming San Francisco 49ers New England Patriots NFL Draft San Antonio Spurs Utah Jazz Draft (sports) Brendan Shanahan Steve Nash 1957 World Series Super Bowl XXVII New York Islanders New Jersey Nets Carolina Panthers Reggie Jackson Damon Allen Qu__bec Nordiques National Basketball Association Equine conformation Norway national football team Detroit Red Wings Atlanta Flames Montreal Canadiens Peter Forsberg Los Angeles Kings Troy Glaus Brett Favre Kansas City Chiefs Buffalo Bills National Football League Ryan Leaf Minnesota Timberwolves Tampa Bay Buccaneers 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dallas Cowboys 1986 NBA Draft NBA Draft Lottery New York Giants WNBA Draft Cleveland Cavaliers Mario Lemieux John Smoltz New York Jets Boston Red Sox FA Cup Raymond Bourque Frank Viola Peyton Manning Alex Rodriguez Jim Dowd (hockey player) Roy Williams (wide receiver) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Daunte Culpepper Terrell Owens Pittsburgh Penguins Playoff Winning Streak Gambling Atlanta Falcons Toronto Blue Jays Pavel Bure 2004-05 NHL lockout New York Mets Alan Ball (footballer) Boston Bruins Kevin Lowe Ty Cobb Robin Ventura Cleveland Browns Oakland Athletics April 2005 in sports Hendrick Motorsports John Elway Tris Speaker The Apprentice 2 Wilt Chamberlain Luther Head Bundesliga (football) Hank Aaron June 2004 in sports Atlanta Hawks Alex Ferguson 2005 NHL Entry Draft Cris Carter Quarashi Trevor Linden Brian Close
