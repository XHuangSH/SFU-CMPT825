should this be brett favre's last year he is still a good player but should he step down before he sucks or should he play the game because he loves it so much i enjoy watching him play more then anybody else in football but maybe it's time to pass the torch before he has an injury that could affect him for life it should be farve's last year only if he wants it to be i honestly think he is starting to lose the passion for the game just because of all the tramatic things that have happened in his life in the past couple of years with the packers going nowhere fast i think that rodgers is going to be taking over the helm if the packers have a really bad year this year farve will most likely relinquish the starting job to rodgers if the packers suck if not farve will be back last thing how come this is in fantasy sports and not football just asking also in the world of fantasy sports i wouldn't even go anywhere near rodgers this year at all even if farve doesn't play the entire year good luck Super Bowl XXXI Brett Favre Super Bowl XXXII Football (soccer) New York Giants American football National Football League Lore Carolina Panthers National Football League Super Bowl I Monday Night Football New England Patriots Cincinnati Bengals Green Bay Packers Kansas City Chiefs Norway national football team Johnny Rodgers Canadian football Sport Baltimore Ravens New York Jets Theory of conduct Dan Marino Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers Bart Starr Aaron Rodgers Michael Vick Volleyball Dallas Cowboys NFL playoffs, 2001-02 NFL playoffs, 1995-96 Football Terrell Owens Baseball April 2005 in sports 1957 World Series The Ashes Friends NFL Most Valuable Player Award NFL playoffs, 1997-98 Atlanta Falcons Avenue Q Sterling Sharpe Jack Charlton West Indian cricket team Vince Lombardi Minnesota Vikings Chicago White Sox American Football League Rugby union Poker jargon September 2005 in sports Football (soccer) positions Pitaten Andy Reid Super League (Australia) Australian cricket team NFL playoffs, 1993-94 Professional American football championship games New York Knicks English cricket team Final Fantasy IX Steve Young (athlete) Denis Law Rugby league Indianapolis 500 Playoff Gaelic football Paul Hornung Wahoo McDaniel Super Bowl II President (game) Ice hockey Jake Plummer Canterbury Bulldogs September 2004 in sports St. Louis Rams NFL playoffs, 2004-05 December 2004 in sports January 2005 in sports Test cricket Arena football Amateur and professional cricketers FC Rostov Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME GunBound Kurt Warner George Abbott National Hockey League All-Star Game Doug Flutie Luck American football strategy Jimmie Rodgers (country singer) Canadian Football League Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Touch football (rugby league) Australian rules football
