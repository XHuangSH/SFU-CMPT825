picking th lots of questions team league snaking picks mostly standard scoring first pick good to expectable westbrook maroney manning henry nd pick manning cedric benson ronnie brown thomas jones benson will not be available as my rd pick i have no idea why he is so low on most draft boards he will get carries this year rd pick if i don t get manning tom brady or top wr if i do get manning any starting rb left jamal lewis brandon jacobs th pick a good wr or carson palmer wr th chicago d baltimore d in our league last year baltimore d was the th highest scorer chicago was th wr or good te my goal is to get the best starters kicker maybe th i don t like wrs they re a crapshoot except the top i always look hard at free agent wrs or trade after the first weeks what does everyone think are there better options any suggestion on good wrs should i try to go rb rb rb and trade most of this is going to be opportunistic picks something could fall fast like a shaun alexander thanks picking th isn't that bad there are the top guys that will be gone lt s jax gore sa lj addai but then that means of guys will be left manning westbrook maroney he seems to be in your top according to what you wrote yeah you'd like to get someone better than maroney and hopefully manning or westbrook will be there still i'm not really a parker fan goal line and r johnson had a bad year last year under ypc and never gets more than tds henry could be there on the way back seen he drop in many leagues just yesterday he went th overall i was shocked i was able to get westbrook at th overall yesterday so don't worry about little talent being there ronnie brown bush and mcgahee are risky but also options as a pick nd you're not getting manning in the second round you are in good position to get him in the st but someone else may steal him even before th overall nd round i like henry t jones bush mcgahee picking later in the draft makes it hard for you to get anthing but a running back in the nd after that your draft stratgy looks the same as what mine would be i think it is a good stategy sleeper wrs evans might be there in the th round and i think not worth passing up mark clayton i grab him around ward and c johnson b jones no one talks about him but he is the only reciever in ten and is looking good in camp galloway he got the yards and tds with brad gowkoski throwing to him garcia will at least duplicate if not improve his fantasy value hackett when d jackson went down it wasn't branch but hackett that emerged as a good fantasy wr last pick dark horse wr is tab perry wide reciever in cin and palmer has made housh and henry not the other way around perry is just as fast and has good size he should beat out chatman for the spot follow their preseason games i'd suggest not going for rbs in rounds because it is more important that you get quality starts and you don't want to get ripped off or get stuck with him New England Patriots Cleveland Browns Buffalo Bills Chicago Bulls Cincinnati Bengals Running back Super Bowl XXVII New York Knicks New York Jets Terrell Owens Dallas Cowboys September 2005 in sports National Football League Lore St. Louis Rams Miami Dolphins Carolina Panthers Canadian football Baltimore Ravens American football Indiana Pacers Poker jargon Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXI Los Angeles Clippers Detroit Red Wings Toronto Blue Jays Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XXXVI Norway national football team National Football League October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XIV Boston Bruins Glossary of American football Cris Carter International League Super Bowl XXXIV 1957 World Series Detroit Tigers Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XIX USC Trojans Football December 2004 in sports Kansas City Chiefs Yao Ming Super Bowl XXXV World Series NFL playoffs, 2001-02 NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Donovan McNabb Toronto Raptors Seattle Mariners Indianapolis 500 Montreal Canadiens Super Bowl III Baseball NFL playoffs, 2004-05 $ale of the Century Wayne Gretzky Ty Cobb West Bromwich Albion F.C.
