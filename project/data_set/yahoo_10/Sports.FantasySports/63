im in a jam have decent starting core for fantasy but not real great backups what would be good acqusitions qb marc buler rb steven jackson wr reggie wayne dst broncos dst te todd heap player i can trade rb jamal lewis wr isaac bruce wr andre johnson wr deion branch wr eddie kennison your wr core is actually semi decent keep branch and johnson as for kennison and bruce see if you can pick up a running back like norwood or bell for kennison the chiefs offense is going to be centered around lj once he signs the extension with no actual qb there there isn't going to be much gonzalez will see most of the balls and then with bowe finally signing kennison won't see that much also with bruce he will most likely be passed up by bennett on the depth chart i would however keep onto him and try and lump him together with a guy like branch to see who you can get some guys like the wr's and some guys don't i wouldn't of course try for guys like harrison chad johnson but guys like glenn coles might be there for that trade lewis is really on the fence with me with brady just signing today he might still be the only offense out in cle country i would keep him though he isn't going to have that bad of year as everybody is thinking if you really wanna trade him you won't get the fantasy value you expect from him like the other guy said just keep waiting though after a couple weeks players will get hurt and start to stand out and that is when you start to pick them up the preseason is long and something always happens right now keep lewis johnson and branch for sure they won't have the best years but better than all those other known players on the fa list good luck Cincinnati Bengals Buffalo Bills New England Patriots New York Giants Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers San Francisco 49ers New York Jets New York Knicks National Football League NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Carolina Panthers Baltimore Ravens Indiana Pacers Super Bowl XXVI Chicago Bulls Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXI Steve Nash Boston Bruins Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXXVIII September 2005 in sports Oakland Athletics Toronto Argonauts Super Bowl XXV Dallas Cowboys Stage name 1957 World Series National Football League Lore Ben Johnson (athlete) Running back Atlanta Falcons Wayne Gretzky Satchel Paige Pittsburgh Penguins Super Bowl XXXI Detroit Red Wings World Series Super Bowl XXXVI John Elway St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XII Oakland Raiders Toronto Raptors Boston Red Sox Los Angeles Kings Robin Ventura Los Angeles Clippers Tris Speaker Doug Flutie Jennifer Lopez Tampa Bay Buccaneers Reggie Jackson Minnesota Vikings Plame affair Grammy Awards of 2004 Super Bowl XXII Pete Sampras Janet Jackson Rod Stewart Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl I ESPN25 105th United States Congress Eighty-second United States Congress October 2005 in sports Miami Hurricanes Football Home run Super Bowl XXXIII Indianapolis Colts Kurt Warner January 2005 in sports Ty Cobb New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Norway national football team Denver Broncos 108th United States Congress Andre Agassi New Zealand at the 2004 Summer Olympics October 16 in baseball 104th United States Congress NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Tony Bennett Seattle Mariners 107th United States Congress December 2004 in sports 2000 Australian Grand Prix New York Islanders Whitney Houston November 2004 in sports 106th United States Congress Washington Redskins
