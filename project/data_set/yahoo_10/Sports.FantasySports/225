new to fantasy football what does waiver selection mean when it says waiver out of basically when a player gets dropped off a team he goes to waivers which means for a week everyone has a chance to pick him up after the week if no one claims him he goes to free agency and anyone can get him right away if someone claims him while he's on waivers they get him once the waiver period is over unless someone with a higher waiver claims him too so say someone drops chad johnson from their team he goes to waivers the guy with the waiver tries to add him you can try to pick up johnson too and since you have the higher waiver number you'll beat him however if the person with the waiver tries to add him too he'll beat you once you successfully win a waiver you drop down to last place and everyone else moves up one but usually most people that get cut end up going through waivers with no one claming them and go to free agency which means you can pick them up if you want them without sacrificing your waiver spot the big thing you'll use your waivers for mostly is if someone makes a for or for trade etc and needs to clear room off his roster they might release a player that's decent in that case and there might be some competition to pick him up usually players that get cut are ones that just really suck or are out for the year with injuries etc though you'll also hear people use the expression get someone off the waiver wire that's just an expression that means picking someone up out of free agency for instance you might only have one defense or kicker and if its on bye you'll need to pick up another defense or kicker off the waiver wire to fill in for the week Pittsburgh Steelers National Football League New England Patriots New York Giants Carolina Panthers Cincinnati Bengals Kansas City Chiefs San Francisco 49ers American football Buffalo Bills Toronto Blue Jays Super Bowl XXVII New York Knicks New York Jets Dallas Cowboys Toronto Raptors Scientology beliefs and practices International League Los Angeles Clippers Utah Jazz National Football League Lore Plame affair Norway national football team Super Bowl XXXVI Rugby league New York Islanders Rugby union Canadian football Miami Dolphins Fantasy football (American) Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXI Glossary of American football Wheel of Fortune Seattle Mariners Chicago Bulls Lewis Libby National Hockey League All-Star Game GunBound Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XXXIV Newcastle United F.C.
