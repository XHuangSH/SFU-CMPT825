suggested line up and playoffs first of all who makes up the suggested line up also what happens to low scoring teams when the playoffs start many times i dont know who to play so i will do the suggested as this is my first year i am th place from bottom of league so just would like to know if the top players are the only ones in playoffs thanks not sure everything you are asking but fantasy playoffs start before the end of regular seasons to ensure every player is still playing as far as the fantasy playoffs if your team doesn't make it th from the bottom probably won't cut it there are sometimes consolation brackets that you can still be involved in Playoff Playoff format Pittsburgh Steelers National Football League National Basketball Association Super Bowl XXVII Chinese Basketball Association Detroit Red Wings 2005 World Series Leicester City F.C.
