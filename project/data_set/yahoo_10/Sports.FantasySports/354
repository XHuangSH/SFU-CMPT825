i'm thinking about trading jeff garcia for big ben good idea big ben is way higher than garcia in fantasy points he's higher by like ninetysome points but the projected value which is what i'm paying attention to is not that far off somewhere between points difference should i go through with this trade also i'm seriously thinking about trading alge crumpler i don't see him having a good year with harrington as his qb any idea who i should trade for i rank big ben way above garcia i have ben as my starting qb in a team and i have no concerns about him if the steelers really are looking to be more aggressive then i think they have the weapons to pull it off garcia is on the bucs and the bucs are not an offensive team i can't see the garcia putting up numbers like he did on the ers big ben is on the way up and garcia is on the way down big ben by a mile over garcia trading crumpler depends on your rbs and wrs if you need more depth then i would go for a rb or wr and then grab a te off the waiver wire if you believe you are strong at rb and wr then try to trade for another te you'd must likely have to package another player with crumpler to get anyone better or else deal with another team who is not aware of michael vick's situation yeah good luck on that one crumpler should still have a decent year and should still end up in the top falcons have a weak wr core and crumpler will be the target for harrington i'd explore my options in trading crumpler but i wouldn't panic and try to force a trade Pittsburgh Steelers NFL playoffs, 2002-03 NFL playoffs, 2004-05 December 2004 in sports New England Patriots Indiana Pacers Poker jargon Kasparov versus The World Diablo II: Lord of Destruction New York Knicks Final Fantasy XI Super Bowl XXVI Boston Red Sox National Football League Super Bowl XXVII Michael Vick Chicago Bulls Ben Roethlisberger Tampa Bay Buccaneers Glossary of American football Donovan McNabb Baseball Team Fortress Classic Seattle Mariners Supply-side economics Tight end Joey Harrington San Francisco 49ers Greenville, North Carolina Jeff Garcia Yao Ming Steve Nash Ra (board game) Knots Landing Cleveland Browns Pok__mon Trading Card Game Super Bowl IX Resident Evil (video game) First Battle of the Atlantic Major League Baseball television contracts American football strategy Warrior (World of Warcraft) Boston Bruins Galactic Civilizations Nickname Utah Jazz Minnesota Vikings October 2005 in sports Chess strategy and tactics Chicago White Sox Scientology beliefs and practices ELO rating system Cincinnati Bengals Basketball Yu-Gi-Oh!
