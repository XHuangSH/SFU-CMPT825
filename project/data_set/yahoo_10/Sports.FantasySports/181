who should i pick rd in my fantasy football draft i would like to draft rb stephen jackson with that pick but he will most likely be taken i've been thinking of taking rb's larry johnson or frank gore what do you think i should do there's some useless advice take s jackson he's not going to be there don't even get your hopes up taking a qb is a bad idea when you won't get another pick until th overall at least and that's a small man snake draft which means the best you can do at running back in the second round is e james according to the yahoo bigger board and also can you really trust someone that says to take david addai come on like that guy has played fantasy football before it s joseph addai what i would advise you to do is take gore the hand is not a big deal and it will be healed by week just no playing time in preseason hand injuries won't affect his running his legs and power are still as strong as ever it could affect his catching and fumbling but i doubt it the hand is supposed to be healed and maybe it will encourage hands on the ball which wouldn't hurt as for lj he is a major risk that you don't want to pick rd overall lj s risk includes the holdout new qb can you say in the box lose of another pro bowl lineman and injury risk so many carries reminds me of what they did to priest the way they run him to death lj is a great back but what good is a great back if he sits out until week gore has just as much upside without the down side sfs offense is based around gore and they give opportunities similar to lj addai and alexander are obviously not on the same level of gore and lj and that's why you didn't even mention them addai should do a little under of what addai and rhodes did last year and tds that's not top material that's rudi johnson like numbers not lj i'm sure someone will spell him sub for him a little too or else that will bring up more injury risk hasn't proved that he can carry the load alexander is getting older and doesn't have hutchinson he struggled even before the injury alexander does have a lot of upside and he's my running back behind gore addai lj i worry about the hold out but gore has the best chance of winning you a championship if lj does end the hold out before your draft he'd move to my running backs i still think gore has a better chance to succeed even if lj doesn't hold out San Francisco 49ers Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants Cleveland Browns New England Patriots National Football League Buffalo Bills American football Super Bowl XXVI New York Jets Super Bowl IX National Football League Lore Glossary of American football Super Bowl XIII Fast bowling Carolina Panthers Kansas City Chiefs Aerial (dance move) 1957 World Series Indiana Pacers Brian Close Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXXIV New York Knicks Equine conformation Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl X Norway national football team Professional wrestling throws Super Bowl XXVIII Miami Dolphins St. Louis Rams Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl V Professional wrestling attacks Super Bowl XIV Oakland Raiders Professional wrestling holds The Contender (television series) Los Angeles Clippers Super Bowl XXII Extreme Programming Super Bowl XIX Running back Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo Junior Saga U.S. Electoral College Bryan Robson Iron Bowl U.S. presidential election, 2008 Minnesota Vikings Houston Rockets Leon White Super Bowl I Super Bowl III Super Bowl XVIII Rugby union Al Gore Ben Johnson (athlete) Plame affair World Series Super Bowl XXIII John Edwards Ryan Leaf American football strategy Super Bowl XVII Jacksonville Jaguars Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Professional wrestling slang Miami Hurricanes Football Super Bowl XXXVIII Canadian football ELO rating system English cricket team Super Bowl XII Good Times Toronto Raptors Super Bowl VII Philadelphia Eagles Satchel Paige Terrell Owens Tris Speaker Jack Charlton Instant-runoff voting Super Bowl VI Steve Nash Alex Ferguson Major League Baseball television contracts Utah Jazz Football (soccer)
