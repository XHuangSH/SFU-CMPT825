should i take this trade i trade driver delhomme and ward and i get walker and cutler i already hav holt ward m calyton and k curtis as my wr cutler is a big upgrade over delhomme and that is good walker and driver are a wash and your throwing in ward thus the difference between delhomme and cutler i don't know who your starting qb is or if delhomme is your starter so to make an informed decision first i'll assume they are your starters i would then say yes make the deal because you are upgrading your starting qb position and only down grading your st receiver off the bench if neither of these qb's is your starter then i'd pass on this trade because you are not helping your starting line up and your losing a potential bench spot ask yourself if you'd trade delhomme and ward for cutler the answer is yes if he is your starter and no if he is your nd string qb make sense Carolina Panthers Jake Delhomme New York Jets Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXVII Toronto Raptors Pittsburgh Steelers New York Giants 1986 NBA Draft Kurt Warner Ricky Ray Toronto Blue Jays NFL playoffs, 2003-04 New York Knicks Detroit Tigers Indiana Pacers Yao Ming Cleveland Browns 1957 World Series Chucky Pancamo Drag racing Henry Cow Donovan McNabb New England Patriots Starting pitcher Windows Vista Red Sox Nation History of Microsoft Windows Super Bowl IX Tris Speaker Indianapolis 500 Vernon Schillinger Pedro Mart__nez Florida Marlins Damon Allen David Wells Reggie Jackson October 2005 in sports Baseball James K.
