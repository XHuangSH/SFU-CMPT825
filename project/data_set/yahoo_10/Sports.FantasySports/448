i traded away julius jones and steve mcnair for edgerrin james and byron leftwich was this a good trade once i get james and leftwich i'm thinking about dropping byron for jeff garcia should i do that either one is my backup qb after tom brady anyway absolutely this trade is not even close edge is well underrated this year as he could potentially be a top back again and is definately a solid number back i wouldn't even want julius jones on my roster barber is going to score of dallas' rushing touchdowns i would be surprised if jones gets more than red zone carries this year the only reason he still gets playing time is because they invested so much money in him with his rookie contract barber is the future back in dallas and is becoming the now back as well mcnair and leftwich is sort of a toss up but at least you know mcnair is going to play football this year who knows with leftwich you sure pulled a fast one on that guy New England Patriots New York Giants Super Bowl XXXIV Pittsburgh Steelers St. Louis Rams NFL playoffs, 2003-04 September 2005 in sports Carolina Panthers Buffalo Bills San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXI Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXV National Football League Lore Jacksonville Jaguars Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXXVI Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XIII NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XXXVIII Running back Super Bowl XV Tennessee Titans Super Bowl X October 2005 in sports NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 New York Knicks Cincinnati Bengals Steve McNair Super Bowl XIX American football Super Bowl VII Super Bowl III Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl IX NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXII Tom Brady Boston Bruins Super Bowl XXX Montreal Canadiens Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XXXIX Miami Dolphins Washington Redskins November 2004 in sports Major League Soccer Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXVIII Major League Baseball television contracts American Football League New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Baltimore Ravens Professional wrestling throws National Football League Super Bowl XX NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl XVIII International League Philadelphia Flyers Baseball Kyle Boller Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXIX Super Bowl VIII Toronto Blue Jays NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Marshall University British Columbia Lions History of Test cricket (to 1883) Steve Nash Doug Flutie Terrell Owens Knots Landing Canadian football Damon Allen Fast bowling January 2005 in sports Chicago White Sox PGA Tour Boston Red Sox Walter Payton San Antonio Spurs Ricky Ray December 2004 in sports Miami Hurricanes Football
