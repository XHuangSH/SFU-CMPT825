      "the first time was to think about how to make the building building , in a city city , a city that almost almost almost every day . \n",
      "we created a call the , by by on the roof on the roof . \n",

      "what would the best best in in a a climate for a apartment ? \n",
      "this is <unk> , because of the <unk> between the between the between the two <unk> that created created created and a natural natural . . \n",
      "so we put a pattern about the the that that most of the most that are are in in this direction . \n",

      "first of all , these buildings are very empty , because they 're very large large , where people ca n't afford to buy things things . \n",

      "so i thought , this is exactly what i really want to design , not a a mall . \n",
      "but the question was , how could we create a building , building building building with these principles . \n",
      "the next challenge came to when we were looking at this , because it 's in a proper town of the city , where most of the buildings you were sitting on the picture , there were n't there . \n",
      "it 's between between two two that have hundreds of hundreds of meters . \n",
      "first first , we created a connection between these two streets , and then there all all the walls of the building . \n",
      "this is moving into a <unk> - , which is a a a building in which building itself through its own shape and its sun and rain . \n",
      "in order to get this <unk> , , we get the idea of a with with a little little that is moving in every every , because because of because of the shape of the change . \n",
      "i also think : how do we close the buildings ? \n",
      "i really wanted to find a solution in the local local . . \n",
      "i began to think about think about how a a out of concrete out of concrete , which air the air , and the light light , but in the form form . \n",
      "and then i called these beautiful buttons in the the <unk> . . \n",
      "they have the characteristics of a a geometry , and that helped me to the entire entire . . \n",
      "we 're building it with these little little bits , the windows , the air and air light into the buildings into the buildings . \n",
      "and that 's being done by these little , , little bits that leaves the light from the the of the the to to building the building a building . . \n",
      "it was n't just the the to to with these ideas , because they thought , \" this is not a nuclear mall . we did n't have it . \" \n",
      "but then we realized realized that this idea of the is much more than the idea of a a , , because they can actually sell more more . \n",
      "so the concept of the was too much , much more much , it 's not just because because of the material compared to glass glass , but also because we do n't have any conditioning . \n",
      "so we created some <unk> techniques that we used to use this project . \n",
      "the first time was to think about how we could make the building building , in a city city in a city that almost nearly a daily day . \n",
      "we created a call that we by by on the roof on the roof roof . \n",
      "and under these <unk> , , we we this this as as a new public space with space and and , and that that this this this . . \n",

      "hopefully at the beginning of the next year , because we 've got the down to 5 . \n",
      "the second example is an <unk> example of 2000 in russia and institutions in <unk> . . \n",
      "so to make a big project , the biggest project i 've ever designed , i had to understand the city of the city , but also the environment , the tradition , the tradition and the culture . \n",
      "during this analysis analysis , i 'm particularly specifically to the the , , which is the 1,000 - old - old structure that was a by a wall , through 12 12 , and through by the lines . \n",
      "when i went to the site , the first step to create the existing streets to create the first 12 blocks , with the size of the size and properties like the in cities and in other cities cities . \n",
      "in addition , we we some some points points in the into into the into the concept of the , and and it with with straight lines , and that changed the original pattern . \n",
      "the last step was to think about the cell , the little cell of the project , like the apartment , as a of part of the . . \n",
      "what was the best best in in a <unk> climate for a apartment ? \n",
      "this is <unk> , because , because of the <unk> between between the two <unk> that are created created and created a natural design . \n",
      "so we put a pattern about the the that that most of the apartments are in in this direction . \n",
      "and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of a european , and the arab city . \n",
      "there are the blocks with <unk> and and in the , there are these compounds for \n",
      "it also also the local wall that produces the density density into the upper and and a a density density in the . . \n",
      "it also also the concept of the . . \n",
      "the volume has this shape form that has evolved through three different layers , and it into very dense to light light into the ground , , there are three different institutions , like a <unk> and a kindergarten and and a near a series of activity that are bringing\n",

      "but i course , i can look at the places that the are are the the source to believe that it 's a . . \n",
      "if you look at a look at a period of a , it 's not a lot of . \n",
      "in fact , people the people who were 20 years ago , mainly journalists and politicians , still <unk> . \n",

      "do you trust trust ? \n",
      "do you trust trust ? \n",
      "and then would you would say , \" well ? \" \n",

      "and if you understand the answer to you , you might say , \" i 'm not some of you , but not . \" \n",

      "in short short , we 're in in our short lives , we 're trust in different ways . \n",
      "we do n't think of it that we have every heart or a in in a or or or . \n",
      "so i could like to say that i was given a given , i , , the first class , the first class class , , but i would n't want to drive the . . \n",
      "maybe i know i know know that it 's not going to be good car . \n",
      "and i realized that my my friend had a a conversation on running , , but maybe not that they 're a secret secret . \n",
      "simple . \n",
      "so know how we know from our everyday ways , how different things look like , but why do n't we know this knowledge when we think about trust ? \n",
      "the , there 's a very bad thing about the actual , , because they ignore the sense sense of the you you . \n",
      "second , , we come to the goal . \n",
      "the goal is to trust more confidence . \n",
      "honestly , i think that 's the stupid . \n",
      "i would n't do that . . \n",
      "i would try to trust the more confidence , but not wo n't . \n",

      "\" trust trust \" is no <unk> goal in this life . \n",
      "trust trust and and should be the goal . \n",
      "and then you say , yes , ok , what is the most important , is not trust , but . \n",
      "the the people from humans . \n",
      "and to do that , we need to look at three things things . \n",
      "are you ? ? are you honest ? are you ? ? \n",
      "when we talk a person in the the topics , , , and and , , then we have a good reason to trust their confidence , it 's be . . \n",
      "it 's not the person , but it 's probably not . . \n",
      "some of my friends are friends and honest , i would n't give you a letter letter , because they are <unk> . \n",

      "but after that , we look forward , then , trust . \n",
      "trust is the response . \n",
      "so we have to do that , of course , that 's hard . \n",
      "over the past decades decades , we 've been trying to tackle up with all sorts of problems and experts and experts and experts and make it easier to save us . \n",
      "many lot of these systems have the effect effect . \n",

      "it 's people people like <unk> people from their their tasks , by taking them . . \n",
      "now , anyone can can any any examples . \n",

      "it 's not easy . you 've got to do it . simple reactions or does n't matter . . \n",

      "this as an actor of the describe to describe the the . . \n",
